"Fossil fuels and climate change: the facts

What is the link between fossil fuels and climate change?
When fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the air. Greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere, causing global warming. Already the average global temperature has increased by 1C. Warming above 1.5°C risks further sea level rise, extreme weather, biodiversity loss and species extinction, as well as food scarcity, worsening health and poverty for millions of people worldwide.

What are fossil fuels?
Fossil fuels are formed from the decomposition of buried carbon-based organisms that died millions of years ago. They create carbon-rich deposits that are extracted and burned for energy. They are non-renewable and currently supply around 80% of the world’s energy. They are also used to make plastic, steel and a huge range of products. There are three types of fossil fuel – coal, oil and gas.

How big is the impact of fossil fuels on climate change and our planet?
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found that emissions from fossil fuels are the dominant cause of global warming. In 2018, 89% of global CO2 emissions came from fossil fuels and industry.

Coal is a fossil fuel, and is the dirtiest of them all, responsible for over 0.3C of the 1C increase in global average temperatures. This makes it the single largest source of global temperature rise.

Oil releases a huge amount of carbon when burned - approximately a third of the world’s total carbon emissions. There have also been a number of oil spills in recent years that have a devastating impact on our ocean’s ecosystem.

Natural gas is often promoted as a cleaner energy source than coal and oil. However, natural gas is still a fossil fuel and accounts for a fifth of the world’s total carbon emissions.

Can we keep burning fossil fuels?
The IPCC warns that fossil fuel emissions must be halved within 11 years if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

In 2015, the world’s governments signed up to the Paris Agreement committing to reduce carbon emissions. However, a recent report by the UN Environment Programme shows that globally, we are on track to produce more than double the amount of coal, oil and gas by 2030 than we can burn if we are to limit global warming by 1.5C. So more needs to be done.

What’s the role of fossil fuel companies in the future of our planet?
Fossil fuel companies remain huge polluters, producing and selling fossil fuel products while scientists say we need a mass switch to renewable energy and efficiency. In 2019, BP spent millions on an advertising campaign about its low-carbon energy and cleaner natural gas. While its advertising focused on clean energy, in reality, more than 96% of BP’s annual expenditure is still on oil and gas. And it is definitely not just BP – it’s an industry-wide problem.

That’s why, in December of 2019, we lodged a complaint with the UK National Contact Point about BP’s adverts. We also launched a campaign calling for a ban on fossil fuel advertising unless it comes with a tobacco-style health warning. Because the public should know the whole truth about fossil fuels.

In February 2020, BP withdrew its advertisements and its CEO Bernard Looney said they would not be replaced under the company’s new policy promising an end to ‘corporate reputation advertising’. He also committed BP to redirecting its advertising resources towards advocating for progressive climate policies."
"The use of fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas—results in significant climate, environmental, and health costs that are not reflected in market prices. These costs are known as externalities. Each stage of the fossil fuel supply chain, from extraction and transportation to refining and burning, generates externalities. This fact sheet provides a survey of some of the externalities associated with fossil fuels.


 

Climate Externalities


When fossil fuels are burned, they emit greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide that trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere and contribute to climate change. In 2019, fossil fuels accounted for 74 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly 25 percent of emissions in the United States come from fossil fuels extracted from public lands. Some of the climate externalities of fossil fuels include:

Ocean acidification: At least a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted from fossil fuels is absorbed by the ocean, changing its chemistry (pH). The increased acidity makes it harder for marine organisms to build shells and coral skeletons. Over the last 150 years, ocean acidity has increased by 30 percent, posing threats to coral reefs, fishing, tourism, and the economy.
Extreme weather: According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, climate change, brought upon by burning fossil fuels, is contributing to more frequent and severe extreme weather events that lead to disasters costing at least a billion dollars each. The cost of extreme weather events, including wildfires, hurricanes, wind storms, flooding, and droughts, between 2016 and 2020 in the United States has been estimated at $606.9 billion.
Sea level rise: Oceanic and atmospheric warming due to climate change is melting glaciers and land-based ice sheets, resulting in global sea level rise. Sea levels have risen about 9 inches since the late 1800s, causing more frequent flooding, destructive storm surges, and saltwater intrusion. With 40 percent of the U.S. population living along the coasts, it is estimated that defending coastal communities from sea level rise could cost $400 billion over the next 20 years.
 

Environmental Externalities

Fossil fuels have significant environmental externalities including:

Air pollution: Fossil fuels produce hazardous air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, and mercury, all of which are harmful to the environment and human health (as discussed in the health section below). Air pollution from fossil fuels can cause acid rain, eutrophication (excessive nutrients that can harm aquatic ecosystems by lowering oxygen levels), damage to crops and forests, and harm to wildlife.
Water pollution: From oil spills to fracking fluids, fossil fuels cause water pollution. Each fracking well uses between 1.5 million to 16 million gallons of water, and the resulting wastewater can be toxic, often containing substances like arsenic, lead, chlorine, and mercury that can contaminate groundwater and drinking water.
Plastic pollution: Over 99 percent of plastics are made from fossil fuels. Globally, 300 million tons of plastic waste are produced each year, 14 million tons of which end up in the ocean, killing wildlife and polluting the food chain. Plastics also have climate consequences: the U.S. plastic industry produces 232 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, and the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions are expected to surpass those of coal-fired power plants by 2030.
Oil spills: Fossil fuel extraction, transportation, and refining can lead to oil spills that harm communities and wildlife, destroy habitats, erode shorelines, and result in beach, park, and fishery closures. The largest oil spill in history, the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon spill, released 134 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 people and countless birds, turtles, fish, marine mammals, and plants—and cost BP $65 billion in penalties and cleanup costs.
 

Health Externalities

Air pollution from burning fossil fuels can cause multiple health issues, including asthma, cancer, heart disease, and premature death. Combusting the additives found in gasoline—benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene—produces cancer-causing ultra-fine particles and aromatic hydrocarbons. Globally, fossil fuel pollution is responsible for one in five deaths. In the United States, 350,000 premature deaths in 2018 were attributed to fossil fuel-related pollution, with the highest number of deaths per capita in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. The annual cost of the health impacts of fossil fuel-generated electricity in the United States is estimated to be up to $886.5 billion.

The environmental and health impacts of fossil fuels disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities. Black and Hispanic Americans are exposed to 56 and 63 percent more particulate matter pollution, respectively, than they produce. In a predominantly Black and low-income area of Louisiana known as “Cancer Alley,” the cancer risk is nearly 50 times higher than the national average due to 150 nearby chemical plants and oil refineries.

 

Policy Mechanisms to Reduce Fossil Fuel Externalities

Several policy mechanisms have been proposed to reduce fossil fuel externalities, including:

Eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, which could generate $35 billion in taxpayer savings over the next ten years. To learn more about policy mechanisms to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, check out EESI’s fact sheet.
Increasing the social cost of carbon (SCC), which estimates the often-uncounted economic damages that result from carbon dioxide emissions. The federal government uses SCC to evaluate the climate impacts of policies.
A federal clean electricity standard, which would require a percentage of the electricity sold by utilities to come from clean electricity sources. Such standards already exist in several states and usually require the share of clean energy on the electric grid to increase over time.
A carbon price, which sets a price on carbon dioxide emissions that is paid by emitters. Carbon price policies can be structured in different ways, including as a carbon tax. Cap-and-trade programs like the Northeast's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, in which the market determines a carbon price, have existed at the subnational level for many years, reducing emissions and creating new revenue streams for clean energy investments."
"For more than a century, burning fossil fuels has generated most of the energy required to propel our cars, power our businesses, and keep the lights on in our homes. Even today, oil, coal, and gas serve about 80 percent of our energy needs.

And we’re paying the price. Using fossil fuels for energy has exacted an enormous toll on humanity and the environment—from air and water pollution to global warming. That’s beyond all the negative impacts from petroleum-based products such as plastics and chemicals. Here’s a look at what fossil fuels are, what they cost us (beyond the wallet), and why it’s time to move toward a clean energy future.

What Are Fossil Fuels?
Coal, crude oil, and natural gas are all considered fossil fuels because they were formed from the fossilized, buried remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Because of their origins, fossil fuels have a high carbon content.

Examples of Fossil Fuels
Oil
Crude oil, or petroleum (literally “rock oil” in Latin), is a liquid fossil fuel made up mostly of hydrocarbons (hydrogen and carbon compounds). Oil can be found in underground reservoirs; in the cracks, crevices, and pores of sedimentary rock; or in tar sands near the earth’s surface. It’s accessed by drilling, on land or at sea, or by strip mining in the case of tar sands oil and oil shale. Once extracted, oil is transported to refineries via supertanker, train, truck, or pipeline to be transformed into usable fuels such as gasoline, propane, kerosene, and jet fuel—as well as products such as plastics and paint.

Petroleum products supply about 35 percent of U.S. energy needs, with the transportation sector consuming the most. U.S. oil consumption in 2016 was 10 percent below the record high of 2005 and only 3 percent higher than during the 1973–74 embargo by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)—despite the U.S. economy tripling in size in the decades since. Demand for oil plummeted during the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it has now risen to its highest point since 2019. This is partly due to the volatile global market amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Still, U.S. consumption of petroleum products is forecast to decrease, at least through 2038, as fuel efficiency standards lead to cleaner-running vehicles. Continued strengthening of clean car and fuel economy standards remains critical for reducing oil consumption.

On the production side, the United States has experienced a decade-long upswing. Production growth is due in large part to advancements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, technologies that have created a boom in U.S. shale oil and natural gas extraction. While horizontal drilling enables producers to drill down and outward—thus reaching more oil or gas from a single well—hydraulic fracturing (also known as fracking) is designed to extract oil or natural gas from unyielding rock, including shale and other formations. Fracking involves blasting huge quantities of water mixed with chemicals and sand deep into a well, at pressures high enough to fracture rock and enable the oil or gas to escape. This controversial method of extraction creates a host of environmental and health problems, including air and water pollution.

Coal
Coal is a solid, carbon-heavy rock that comes in four main varieties, differentiated largely by carbon content: lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous, and anthracite. Nearly all of the coal burned in the United States is sub-bituminous or bituminous. Found in abundance in states, including Kentucky, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wyoming, these coal types are middle of the pack in terms of carbon content and the heat energy they can produce. Regardless of variety, however, all coal is dirty. Indeed, in terms of emissions, it’s the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel we can burn.

Coal is extracted via two methods: Underground mining uses heavy machinery to cut coal from deep underground deposits, while surface mining (also known as strip mining) removes entire layers of soil and rock to access coal deposits below. Strip mining accounts for about two-thirds of coal sourced in the United States. Although both forms of mining are detrimental to the environment, strip mining is particularly destructive, uprooting and polluting entire ecosystems.

Coal and the power plants that burn it account for less than a third of U.S. electricity generation, down from more than half in 2008. Cleaner, cheaper alternatives—including natural gas, renewables like solar and wind, and energy-efficient technologies—make coal far less economically attractive and demand for coal has fallen steadily since 2014. Today, coal-fired power plants continue to close, despite the former Trump administration’s promises of a revived industry. At the moment, market fluctuations amid the war in Ukraine have resulted in a sudden uptick in coal consumption, especially in its competition with fracked (natural) gas, but that is expected to be temporary as market forces propel alternative energy sources forward.

Fracked (natural) gas
Composed mostly of methane, fracked gas is generally considered either conventional or unconventional, depending on where it’s found underground. Conventional gas is located in porous and permeable rock beds or mixed into oil reservoirs and can be accessed via standard drilling. Unconventional gas is essentially any form of gas that is too difficult or expensive to extract via regular drilling, requiring a special stimulation technique, such as fracking.

In the United States, the development and refinement of processes like fracking have helped make the country the world’s top producer of gas since 2009—and the biggest consumer of it too. Abundant in the United States, gas produces 38 percent of U.S. energy needs and is the largest source of energy for electricity. Forecasts suggest it will become an even greater part of the U.S. energy mix, threatening to exacerbate air and water pollution.

Disadvantages of Fossil Fuels

Land degradation
Unearthing, processing, and moving underground oil, gas, and coal deposits take an enormous toll on our landscapes and ecosystems. The fossil fuel industry leases vast stretches of land for infrastructure, such as wells, pipelines, and access roads, as well as facilities for processing, waste storage, and waste disposal. In the case of strip mining, entire swaths of terrain—including forests and whole mountaintops—are scraped and blasted away to expose underground coal or oil. Even after operations cease, the nutrient-leached land will never return to what it once was.

As a result, critical wildlife habitat—land that is crucial for breeding and migration—ends up fragmented and destroyed. Even animals able to leave can end up suffering, as they’re often forced into less-than-ideal habitat and must compete with existing wildlife for resources.

Water pollution
Coal, oil, and gas development pose myriad threats to our waterways and groundwater. Coal mining operations wash toxic runoff into streams, rivers, and lakes and dump vast quantities of unwanted rock and soil into streams. Oil spills and leaks during extraction or transport can pollute drinking water sources and jeopardize entire freshwater or ocean ecosystems. Fracking and its toxic fluids have also been found to contaminate drinking water, a fact that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was slow to recognize.

Meanwhile, all drilling, fracking, and mining operations generate enormous volumes of wastewater, which can be laden with heavy metals, radioactive materials, and other pollutants. Industries store this waste in open-air pits or underground wells that can leak or overflow into waterways and contaminate aquifers with pollutants linked to cancer, birth defects, neurological damage, and much more.

Emissions
Fossil fuels emit harmful air pollutants long before they’re burned. Indeed, some 17.6 million Americans are exposed daily to toxic air pollution from active oil and gas wells and from transport and processing facilities. These include benzene (linked to childhood leukemia and blood disorders) and formaldehyde (a cancer-causing chemical). A booming fracking industry will bring that pollution to more backyards, despite mounting evidence of the practice’s serious health impacts. Mining operations are no better, especially for the miners themselves, generating toxic airborne particulate matter. Strip mining—particularly in places such as Canada’s boreal forest—can release giant carbon stores held naturally in the wild.

Burning Fossil Fuels
Global warming pollution
When we burn oil, coal, and gas, we don’t just meet our energy needs—we drive the current global warming crisis as well. Fossil fuels produce large quantities of carbon dioxide when burned. Carbon emissions trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to climate change. In the United States, the burning of fossil fuels, particularly for the power and transportation sectors, accounts for about three-quarters of our carbon emissions.

Other forms of air pollution
Fossil fuels emit more than just carbon dioxide when burned. Coal-fired power plants single-handedly generate 35 percent of dangerous mercury emissions in the United States, as well as two-thirds of U.S. sulfur dioxide emissions (which contribute to acid rain) and the vast majority of soot (particulate matter) in our air. Meanwhile, fossil fuel–powered cars, trucks, and boats are the main contributors of poisonous carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide, which produces smog on hot days and leads to respiratory illnesses from sustained exposure.

Ocean acidification
When we burn oil, coal, and gas, we change the ocean’s basic chemistry, making it more acidic. Our seas absorb as much as a quarter of all man-made carbon emissions. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution (and our coal-burning ways), the ocean has become 30 percent more acidic. As the acidity in our waters goes up, the amount of calcium carbonate—a substance used by oysters, lobsters, and countless other marine organisms to form shells—goes down. This can slow growth rates, weaken shells, and imperil entire food chains.

Ocean acidification impacts coastal communities as well. In the Pacific Northwest, it’s estimated to have cost the oyster industry millions of dollars and thousands of jobs.

Building a Clean Energy Future
We’re not locked into a fossil fuel future, however. We’ve made major progress in scaling up renewable energy and energy efficiency in the United States over the past decade, thanks to federal, state, and local policies that have helped to grow the clean energy economy. We’re also using energy much more efficiently than we used to.

State and federal incentives, along with falling prices, are pushing our nation—and the world—toward cleaner, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Renewables are on track to become a cheaper source of energy than fossil fuels, which is spurring a boom in clean energy development and jobs. Significantly higher levels of renewables can be integrated into our existing grid, though care must be taken to site and build renewable energy responsibly.

Meanwhile, energy efficiency is our cleanest, cheapest, and largest energy resource, contributing more to the nation’s energy needs over the past 40 years than oil, coal, natural gas, or nuclear power. It accounted for nearly 2.4 million U.S. jobs before the pandemic in 2019—at least 10 times more than oil and gas drilling or coal mining.

If we can put the right policies in place, we are poised to make dramatic progress toward a clean energy future. In fact, President Biden has proposed a target of the country running on 80 percent clean electricity by 2030. To meet that target, we will need to ramp up efficiency and cut energy demand in half, increase renewable energy resources to supply at least 80 percent of our power, electrify almost all forms of transportation, and get fossil fuels out of our buildings. Achieving these goals will require sustained, coordinated policy efforts from all levels of government, the private sector, and local communities. But with the proven, demonstrated clean energy technologies and resources that we have today, we know we can do it."

What Are Fossil Fuels?
Fossil fuels are energy sources that form naturally via the long-term decomposition of plants and animals. Fossil fuels like petroleum, coal, and natural gas have satisfied human energy demands since the Industrial Revolution.


3 Types of Fossil Fuels
The majority of fossil fuel use comes from just a few types of fuels.

1. Coal: Coal is a solid fuel that is composed primarily of carbon. Depending on its carbon composition, coal can be classified as lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous, or anthracite. The vast majority of coal burned in the United States is bituminous or sub-bituminous. Coal can be extracted via underground mining or strip mining from the surface (sometimes called mountaintop removal).
2. Natural gas: Natural gas is a gaseous fuel. Natural gas extraction can occur during coal mining or oil drilling. Natural gas can also be extracted from oil shales via hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.
3. Oil: Crude oil is a liquid fuel that can be refined to create gasoline, kerosene, propane, jet fuel, paint, and plastics. It can be found in pure liquid form in oil deposits or mixed with viscous sand and rock in tar sands.
How Are Fossil Fuels Used?
Fossil fuels have powered countless sectors of human activity for decades. Uses for fossil fuels include:

Electricity generation: Coal and natural gas power the majority of power plants around the world. They compete with nuclear power, water power, solar power, and wind power—all of which produce fewer carbon emissions than fossil fuel use—but remain the dominant fuel sources around the world.
Home heating: Natural gas (a byproduct of coal mining) powers many home heating systems, hot water heaters, and gas stoves. In recent years, concern about in-home burning of nitrogen oxides (found in natural gas) has led some consumer advocacy groups to propose shifting from gas appliances to electric.
Transportation fuel: Gasoline and diesel, both petroleum products, currently power most consumer vehicles. Aircraft are powered by jet fuel, which is similar in composition to kerosene.
Plastics: Plastics are created from oil. Plastic manufacturing was initially a byproduct of oil refined for electricity and transit, but now over 300 million tons of plastic are produced every year.
3 Impacts of Fossil Fuel Use on the Environment
According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the burning of fossil fuels causes community health risks, pollution, and global warming. The environmental impacts of fossil fuels include:

1. Air pollution: The burning of fossil fuels, particularly coal, can release harmful chemicals like sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide into the air. The health effects of air pollution include severe asthma, which has been observed in regions downwind of coal power plants.
2. Water pollution: The sulfur dioxide released from untreated coal smoke can mix with other elements and produce acid rain, and oil spills poison marine ecosystems. While water pollution is not unique to fossil fuels (even so-called clean energy sources like nuclear can pollute water), unregulated fuel spillage pollutes water and endangers plants, animals, and human health.
3. Global warming: Methane and carbon dioxide emissions stemming from electricity plants, gasoline-burning vehicles, cement manufacturing, and other industrial processes trap heat in Earth's atmosphere, leading to a surge in global temperatures in recent decades."
"What are Fossil Fuels?
The substances which act as energy sources are known as fuels. The buried organic matters which can be converted to crude oil, coal, natural gas or any heavy oils by applying pressure and heat to the earth’s crust over hundreds of years are known as fossil fuels. This topic educates about the effect of burning fossil fuels on the environment.

A good fuel is one which is readily available at a cheap rate and produces a moderate amount of heat on burning.
The amount of energy produced by 1 kilogram of fuel is known as its calorific value.
A fuel which burns completely in the air at a moderate rate and produces a large amount of energy is known as an ideal fuel.
No fuel has such properties and hence ideal fuel is not easy to obtain.
The Effect of Burning Fuels on the Environment

Effects of fossil fuels on the environment:
The burning of fossil fuels leads to the release of harmful products into the environment. An increase in the consumption of fuel leads to harmful effects on the environment. The following points will clearly depict these effects:

Carbon fuels such as wood, coal, and petroleum release unburnt carbon particles into the environment. These particles are very dangerous pollutants and cause respiratory diseases for example asthma.
When fuels are incompletely burnt, they release carbon monoxide gas into the atmosphere. This gas is very dangerous as it is poisonous in nature. If we burn coal in a closed room, then the person sleeping in that room will be killed by the action of carbon monoxide.
The combustion of fossil fuels also releases a large amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is responsible for global warming. Global warming is a rise in the overall temperature of the earth’s surface. This leads to the melting of polar caps and a rise in the sea level and further results in flooding of coastal regions.
The burning of coal and diesel releases sulphur dioxide gas. This gas is extremely corrosive and suffocating in nature. Petrol gives off oxides of nitrogen. The oxides of sulphur and nitrogen get dissolved in rainwater and form acids. This is known as acid rain. This water is very harmful to plants, animals, and various monuments.
Nowadays these fuels are being replaced by CNG (compressed natural gas) because it is a cleaner fuel and produces less harmful products."
"Fossil fuel corporations are profiting from the continued consumption of coal, oil and gas, which are driving global warming to dangerous levels, but the industry’s bad behavior doesn’t stop with greenhouse gas emissions. Here are 8 reasons why we need a fossil fuel phase out.Fossil fuel corporations are profiting from the continued consumption of coal, oil and gas, which are driving global warming to dangerous levels. A Greenpeace report illustrated the need for managed phase out of fossil fuel production as part of any comprehensive climate policy effort like a Green New Deal. The report shows that without specific policies to constrain fossil fuel supply, then a significant fraction of emissions reductions achieved by policies to reduce demand for fossil fuels could be wiped out.[1]

But the fossil fuel industry’s bad behavior doesn’t stop with greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel companies are also responsible for significant air and water pollution. The burden of this pollution is borne most heavily by low-income and communities of color — and by the industry’s own workers. Fossil fuel companies have also misled the public about the impacts of climate change, corrupted our democracy, and attacked renewable energy solutions.

Here are eight reasons why we should kick off a managed decline of the fossil fuel industry.
1. Fossil fuel companies are wrecking our climate
The science is clear: we cannot continue burning coal, oil, and gas if we are going to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. We need to take transformative action in the next decade to completely phase out fossil fuel production and transition our economy to 100% renewable energy.

If we are able to limit global warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels, we will reduce the risk of extreme heat waves, heavy precipitation, droughts, sea-level rise, polar melting, expanding health risks, and other dangerous climate impacts worldwide.2] Here in the U.S., the climate crisis is already worsening “existing vulnerabilities in communities” and presenting “growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth.”[3] Studies have shown if nothing is done to halt emissions, climate change could cost the U.S. $500 billion every year by 2090.[4]

To successfully limit warming to 1.5°C, we must take dramatic action over the next decade. Globally, we must cut planet-warming greenhouse gas pollution “by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030,” and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.[5] Due to our responsibility for a large portion of historical emissions, the U.S. can and should reduce our emissions at an even faster pace.[6]

Every new ton of greenhouse gas emissions pushes global temperatures closer to the 1.5°C limit, and the amount of carbon we can emit without going over that limit is referred to as our “carbon budget.” At current rates of emissions, the remaining budget will be exhausted in only 12-15 years.[7] Yet fossil fuel corporations have discovered roughly five times more oil, gas, and coal reserves than we can afford to burn and still limit warming to 1.5°C. Already, the amount of carbon found in fossil fuel production projects currently moving forward (known as “developed reserves”) is more than enough to warm the planet to dangerous levels.[8]

Those reserves also represent billions of dollars in profits for fossil fuel executives and shareholders. As continued burning of coal, oil, and gas drives us toward planetary disaster, fossil fuel companies are recklessly digging us into a deeper hole by expanding investments in fossil fuel extraction, rather than the fossil fuel phase out that workers and communities at the frontlines of the climate emergency desperately need.

2. Fossil fuel companies are spending to lock-in climate pollution
Despite the urgent warnings from climate scientists, billions of investment dollars continue to flow to dirty energy companies. Total global investment in energy added up to $1.8 trillion in 2018, of which 35% (~$630 billion) went towards low-carbon energy, and the remainder (~$1.2 trillion) went to fossil fuels.[9] One out of every 10 energy dollars (roughly $170 billion in 2018) goes to fossil fuel supply projects in the U.S. alone, driving the rapid increase in U.S. oil and gas production in recent years.


Global energy investment in 2018 and change compared to 2017. (Source: IEA, World Energy Investment 2019)

Achieving the 1.5°C target will require a radical reallocation of capital from fossil energy to low-carbon solutions.[10] Unfortunately low-carbon investment has “stalled in recent years and needs a rapid boost to keep [our climate goals] in sight.”[11] On the other hand, oil and gas companies are forecast to spend $4.9 trillion in capital expenditures on new oil and gas projects over the next decade — investments which could lock-in emissions that break the carbon budget and push global warming beyond 1.5°C.[12]

3. Fossil fuel companies cause deadly air pollution
In addition to releasing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, burning fossil fuels also generates localized air pollutants — such as soot (fine particulate matter, or PM2.5) and smog (ozone) — that increase the risk of death from stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory illness among those exposed. Air pollution from fossil fuel production and consumption disproportionately affects communities of color and low-income — clearly perpetuating environmental injustices.[13] The World Health Organization estimates that ambient exposure to PM2.5 leads to around 4 million deaths worldwide every year (not counting exposure from indoor air pollution).[14] In the U.S., clean air rules have reduced this public health threat over time,[15] but tens of thousands of Americans still die every year from air pollution.[16] Trump’s attempted rollback of clean air protections could lead to 80,000 additional deaths every decade.[17] Studies have shown that a “rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions” could “save millions of lives.”[18]

4. Fossil fuel companies cause water pollution
Time and time again, oil spills and explosions have wreaked havoc on water, land, and homes and communities. Major incidents — such as BP’s Deepwater Horizon catastrophe, which spilled 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico,[19] or Enbridge’s massive tar sands spill into the Kalamazoo River[20] — show that there is no failsafe way to extract, process, or transport fossil fuels. Where there is drilling, there is inevitably spilling,[21] and too often, these disasters have put marginalized communities under threat. In the last several years, an Indigenous-led movement of water protectors and allies has risen up to oppose risky, climate-wrecking pipeline projects across the country such as Dakota Access, Keystone XL, and the Line 3 expansion. Additionally, the oil and gas boom has put groundwater at risk from wastewater contamination[22] and has consumed scarce water resources.[23] Coal too can contaminate water resources during the mining process and via unregulated coal ash impoundments.[24]

5. Fossil fuel companies perpetuate environmental injustice
The burdens of both climate change and conventional pollution fall more heavily on low-income communities and communities of color. Numerous studies have shown that toxic waste sites are more likely to be found in vulnerable communities[25] and the same is true of coal fired power plants.[26] Race and poverty also predict higher exposure to harmful PM2.5 air pollution.[27] Climate change will also have a highly unequal impact across the world. A recent U.N. study found that climate change could “push more than 120 million more people into poverty by 2030 and will have the most severe impact in poor countries, regions, and the places poor people live and work.”[28]

6. Fossil fuel companies don’t treat workers fairly
Workers in these industries have often not received fair treatment either. Occupational data show that the upstream oil and gas industry has “one of the highest rates of severe injuries in the country,”[29] and after years of decline, black lung disease has made a comeback and is now afflicting Appalachian coal miners “earlier and in a more deadly form than ever before.”[30]

As the coal industry has gone into long-term decline, workers have found that promises made by their corporate bosses have not been kept. In Appalachia, recent years have shown that “as [coal] companies declare bankruptcy, executives get healthy bonuses, polluted coal mines are abandoned, and miners and retirees are denied long-promised health benefits and pensions.”[31] With the recent abrupt closure of two coal mines in Wyoming, the same pattern appears to be playing out there as well. This is why a just transition must be put in place to ensure that workers and communities are left better off as we phase out fossil fuel production.[32]

7. Fossil fuel companies have misled the public about the climate threat
Fossil corporations have known about the scale of the climate threat for decades, but far from warning the public, they spent millions on a campaign to sow doubt and disinformation, leading to decades of delay. Journalists have uncovered documents indicating that industry leaders were funding research into atmospheric CO2 as early as the 1950s and produced a 1968 report to the American Petroleum Institute that starkly warned of the threat of rising temperatures due to carbon pollution.[33] In the late 70s and early 80s, Exxon was funding cutting-edge climate change science,[34] but by the 1990s the company had pivoted to publishing misleading op-eds[35] and funding a network of climate deniers that works to block meaningful climate action to this day.[36] In recent years, other fossil fuel interests, such as the Charles and David Koch, have continued to fund denial and delay.[37]

As a result of these actions, what could have been a manageable economic transition to 100% renewable energy has become an urgent planetary crisis, putting the lives of millions under threat while time runs short to solve the problem.

8. Fossil fuel companies are attacking solutions, while raking in tax breaks
Today, many fossil fuel companies are shifting away from blatant climate denial, claiming to accept the findings of climate science, and perhaps voicing weak support for inadequate policies.[38] When push comes to shove the industry opens its pocket book to defeat any policies that might impact their bottom line. The Koch network has taken aim at climate-friendly policies such as net metering for rooftop solar, and more recently, the tax credit for electric vehicles.[39] When strong climate initiatives made the ballots in Colorado and Washington in 2018, the industry spent millions to defeat them.[40] In July 2019, fossil fuel interests pushed through a bill in the Ohio legislature that bailed-out money-losing coal plants while gutting renewable energy and efficiency standards.[41]

The fossil fuel industry has spent[42] millions of dollars in lobbying[43] and campaign contributions[44] to block any concerted climate action at the federal and state level. So far, this decades-long investment in influencing our political system is paying off. The fossil fuel industry continues to receive around $20 billion in federal and state production subsidies every year,[45] and reaped billions in additional tax savings from Trump’s 2017 tax cut legislation.[46]
It is clear that the current business model of the fossil fuel industry is putting all of us in harm’s way, but in particular, low-income, Indigenous, and communities of color who are on the frontlines of pollution and climate chaos. Fossil fuel interests are still one of the main barriers to the passage of comprehensive climate policies in the U.S. It is time for the industry to face a reckoning."
"The burning of fossil fuels refers to the burning of oil, natural gas, and coal to generate energy. We use this energy to generate electricity, and to power transportation (for example, cars and planes) and industrial processes. Ever since the invention of the first coal-fired steam engines of the 1700s, our burning of fossil fuels has steadily increased.  Across the globe each year we now burn over 4,000 times the amount of fossils fuels burnt during 1776.  The effects of the burning of fossil fuels, especially carbon dioxide, are having far-reaching effects on our climate and ecosystems.

The burning of fossil fuels is the primary cause of current climate change, altering the Earth’s ecosystems and causing human and environmental health problems.Fossil fuels form over millions of years from the burial of photosynthetic organisms, including plants on land (which primarily form coal) and plankton in the oceans (which primarily form oil and natural gas). To grow these organisms removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the ocean, and their burial inhibited the movement of that carbon through the carbon cycle. The burning of this fossil material returns this carbon back into atmosphere as carbon dioxide, at a rate that is hundreds to thousands of times faster than it took to bury, and much faster than can be removed by the carbon cycle.  Thus, the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels accumulates in the atmosphere, some of which then dissolves in the ocean causing ocean acidification.

The burning of fossil fuels affects the Earth system in a variety of ways. Some of these ways include:

Releasing the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere, which intensifies the greenhouse effect (the re-radiation of heat in the atmosphere), increasing the Earth’s average air temperatures. These greenhouse gases can remain in the atmosphere for decades to hundreds of years.
Emitting an array of pollutants that reduce air quality and harm life, especially sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and airborne particles such as soot. Poor air quality can cause respiratory disease.
The airborne particles also increase the reflectivity of the atmosphere, which has a slight cooling effect. The reason is that the airborne particles, such as soot and sulfate aerosols (from sulfur dioxide), reflect some sunlight back into space, increase cloud formation, and make clouds more reflective. The net effect of burning fossil fuels is warming because the cooling is small compared with the heating caused by the greenhouse effect, in part because airborne particles only stay suspended in the atmosphere for a few days to months, while greenhouse gases that cause warming remain in the atmosphere for many decades to hundreds of years.
Changing patterns of snow and ice melt. Airborne particles (especially soot) that settle on snow increase the absorption of sunlight due to their dark color, heating the surface of the snow causing melting. In certain parts of the world, the presence of soot (in addition to global warming) has caused winter ice and snow melts earlier and faster today than in previous decades, which also changes local patterns of freshwater availability.
Increasing the acidity of precipitation. Sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2) react with water vapor, oxygen, and other chemicals to form acid rain. Acid rain can contaminate freshwater sources, resulting in harmful algal blooms that reduce water oxygen levels and harm fish populations and other wildlife. Additionally, acid rain increases chemical weathering of rocks, including manmade structures.
Using large amounts freshwater. Power plants that burn fossil fuels cool their systems by removing freshwater from local rivers and lakes. The warm water returned to nearby ecosystems can cause stress for local species."
"Cars and trucks release nitrogen into the atmosphere, which contributes to nutrient pollution in our air and water.
Airborne nitrogen pollution affects not only the quality of the air we breathe, but also the land and the water. Nitrogen is the most abundant element in the air and is essential to plant and animal life. Sources of nitrogen from human activities, such as electric power generation, industry, transportation and agriculture, can upset the natural balance of nitrogen in the environment.

When fossil fuels are burned, they release nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, which contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain. The most common nitrogen-related compounds emitted into the air by human activities are collectively referred to as nitrogen oxides. Ammonia is another nitrogen compound emitted to the air, primarily from agricultural activities, but also from fossil fuels. Most of the nitrogen oxides released in the U.S. due to human activity are from the burning of fossil fuels associated with transportation and industry.When fossil fuels are burned, they release nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, which contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain.
Major sources of nitrogen oxide emissions include:

Cars and trucks
Coal-fired power plants
Large industrial operations
Ships and airplanes
The presence of excess nitrogen in the atmosphere in the form of nitrogen oxides or ammonia is deposited back onto land, where it washes into nearby water bodies. These excess nutrients contribute to pollution, harmful algal blooms and oxygen-deprived aquatic zones. Excess ammonia and low pH in these areas are toxic to aquatic organisms and affect their survival.

Solutions
Businesses:
There are many ways that businesses can reduce nutrient pollution, including:

Manage and Reduce Emissions
Leading businesses are taking steps to understand and manage their greenhouse gas emissions by preparing annual greenhouse gas inventories and setting long-term targets to reduce emissions.
Increase Energy Efficiency
Improving energy efficiency not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, it is good for a corporation's bottom line. Developing and implementing an effective corporate energy management program allows companies to manage energy with the same expertise used to manage other aspects of their business.
Buy Renewable Energy
Your organization's purchased electricity use can be a significant source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Buying renewable energy, can help reduce your organization's environmental impact while also providing a number of other valuable benefits.
Individuals:
Conserve Energy
Air pollution from energy production leads to acid rain, excess greenhouse gases, and health risks. One important step you can take to minimize airborne nutrient pollution is to conserve energy. You can do this by:
Turning off lights, computers, televisions, video games and other electrical equipment when you're not using them.
Buying equipment that uses less electricity, including lights, air conditioners, heaters, refrigerators and washing machines. Energy Star-certified products and buildings use at least 10 less energy than standard models.
Limiting the use of air conditioning.
Installing a programmable thermostat.
Minimize the Miles
Driving cars and trucks also produces significant amounts of nitrogen oxide emissions. To help cut down on air pollution from cars, you can consolidate driving trips, carpool or take public transportation, such as buses and trains. When possible, consider walking or biking instead of driving."
"Oil is the energy source of our time.  We refine the crude extracted oil into different products like gasoline, jet-fuel, diesel and even plastics.  This fossil fuel has promoted global commerce and is behind many of the greatest technological and social innovations of our day.

However, the environment is paying a serious price for our unbridled consumption of fossil fuels and our climate is warming at a rate that may cause irreversible consequences.  Oil spills, ecological damage, pollution and human health risks are just some of the negative impacts of oil exploration, development and use. 

Dependence on oil as an energy source is a real danger to our national security, our environment and our economy.  Promoting domestic renewable energy sources instead will provide green jobs, safeguard our health and break our reliance on unstable foreign governments and oil cartels.  In addition, mining for oil destroys natural habitats and poses dangers to both workers and residents.  The refining process requires the use of toxic chemicals and high amounts of energy. Transporting and burning oil emits CO2 and other pollutants into the air that we all breathe.

If you want to learn more about oil and how it's used and make, take a look at the US Energy Energy Information Administration.

 

Coal
Coal power plant
Of all the coal used in the United States, 92% is burned to generate electricity.  The Valmont coal-fired power plant in Boulder allows us to turn on our lights at night. As well as run many other kinds of equipment and technology.  Coal has also provided many jobs and helped to raise people’s standard of living all around the world.

So, what's the big deal? The environmental effects of coal-fired power generation can been seen everywhere. Mining coal is extremely dangerous to human health and to the environment. Mercury contamination, ozone pollution and acid rain also stem from the firing of coal. Did you know that Boulder is considered an at-risk group for lung disease, and received an F in the American Lung Association's 2016 State of the Air Report for our ozone levels? Burning coal also emits CO2, a major cause of climate change. Since coal is so heavy it is incredibly energy intensive to transport to where it needs to go, thus adding to the total CO2 emissions of the energy extraction and delivery process. You can learn more about coal and it's impacts from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

 

Natural Gas
A quarter of the U.S. energy consumption comes from natural gas, a mixture of mostly methane and a smaller amount of other hydrocarbons. When natural gas is burned, one of the products is CO2. We use this fossil fuel to heat our homes and to make products like paints, plastics, steel, glass, paper, clothing, and brick. 

Natural Gas Power Plant

The extraction of this fuel source has huge environmental impacts, though.  Hydraulic fracturing (aka fracking), is a controversial means to an end, and often negatively impacts everyone involved with the construction process of the gas rigs and pipelines and the extraction of the gas.  

We have seen this debate heat up locally as municipalities try to place bans on fracking in their communities.  Fracking protestors site the many ecological impacts, such as water contamination and increased rates of disease.  However, many argue that it's development is necessary to support the variable capacity of renewable energy generation.  It is a transition fuel with lower carbon output when compared to oil and coal.

You can learn more about natural gas from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Methane = Potent Greenhouse Gas
Methane is a greenhouse gas that can be much more potent than CO2 when it comes to climate change.  Some major sources of methane are landfills, permafrost melt, agriculture, and natural gas. As waste is broken down by bacteria they release methane, which then can escape into the atmosphere.  If this methane can be trapped and burned as fuel, CO2 is released.  While the CO2 will exist in the atmosphere much longer, methane traps significantly more heat, making it a much bigger contributor to climate change.

Methane capture is becoming a popular way to deal with waste management and energy production with the same project.  CU Student Government has invested in methane capture projects to help offset their carbon emissions."
"Producing and burning fossil fuels creates air pollution that harms our health and generates toxic emissions that drive climate change.
 

From the electricity that lights our homes to the cars we drive to work, modern life was built on fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas. But burning them creates climate change and releases pollutants that lead to early death, heart attacks, respiratory disorders, stroke, asthma, and absenteeism at school and work. It has also been linked to autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer’s disease.

Research from Harvard University, in collaboration with the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester and University College London, found that more than 8 million people died in 2018 from fossil fuel pollution, significantly higher than previous research suggested—meaning that air pollution from burning fossil fuels like coal and diesel was responsible for about 1 in 5 deaths worldwide.

Each year, our team contributes to the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change to track the impacts of climate change on human health across 44 indicators around the world. Our research analyzes the health impacts of burning fossil fuels and shows how much we have to gain by ending our reliance on them. Recent research from our Center:

Identified at least 21 different hazardous air pollutants, as defined by the U.S. EPA, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and hexane, in consumer-grade natural gas supplied to Massachusetts.
Created a new inventory of air pollution impacts from stationary sources over the past decade that shows the negative impacts of burning natural gas and biomass have surpassed coal generation in many states, which is a trend that may continue.
Conducted the first study to determine that Pennsylvania’s statewide setback regulations for fracking do not prevent setback incidents, and identified the potential risks and exposures for people living near fracking or underground natural gas wells.
Showed that more people live closer to underground gas storage wells than previously thought. An estimated 20,000 homes and 53,000 people in predominantly suburban areas of PA, OH, WV, MI, NY, and CA live within a city block of active underground natural gas storage wells.
Developed the science-based case for why it is “appropriate and necessary” for EPA to regulate mercury emissions from the power sector; and why the health benefits of regulation and remaining risks from mercury pollution in the U.S. should be assessed."
"Burning fossil fuels
Some of the most significant hidden costs of fossil fuels are from the air emissions that occur when they are burned. Unlike the extraction and transport stages, in which coal, oil, and natural gas can have very different types of impacts, all fossil fuels emit carbon dioxide and other harmful air pollutants when burned. These emissions lead to a wide variety of public health and environmental costs that are borne at the local, regional, national, and global levels.

Global warming emissions
Of the many environmental and public health risks associated with burning fossil fuels, the most serious in terms of its universal and potentially irreversible consequences is global warming. In 2014, approximately 78 percent of US global warming emissions were energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide. Of this, approximately 42 percent was from oil and other liquids, 32 percent from coal, and 27 percent from natural gas [34].

Non-fossil fuel energy generation technologies, like wind, solar, and geothermal, contributed less than 1 percent of the total energy related global warming emissions. Even when considering the full lifecycle carbon emissions of all energy sources, coal, oil, and natural gas clearly stand out with significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions [35].

The use of fossil fuels in transportation contributes almost 30 percent of all US global warming emissions, rivalling—and likely to surpass—the power sector [36].

Air pollution
Burning fossil fuels emits a number of air pollutants that are harmful to both the environment and public health.

Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions, primarily the result of burning coal, contribute to acid rain and the formation of harmful particulate matter. In addition, SO2 emissions can exacerbate respiratory ailments, including asthma, nasal congestion, and pulmonary inflammation [37]. In 2014, fossil fuel combustion at power plants accounted for 64 percent of US SO2 emissions [38].

Nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, a byproduct of all fossil fuel combustion, contribute to acid rain and ground-level ozone (smog), which can burn lung tissue and can make people more susceptible to asthma, bronchitis, and other chronic respiratory diseases. Fossil fuel-powered transportation is the primary contributor to US NOx emissions [39].

Acid rain is formed when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides mix with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere, leading to rain and other precipitation that is mildly acidic. Acidic precipitation increases the acidity of lakes and streams, which can be harmful to fish and other aquatic organisms. It can also damage trees and weaken forest ecosystems [40].

Particulate matter (soot) emissions produce haze and can cause chronic bronchitis, aggravated asthma, and elevated occurrence of premature death. In 2010, it is estimated that fine particle pollution from US coal plants resulted in 13,200 deaths, 9,700 hospitalizations, and 20,000 heart attacks. The impacts are particularly severe among the young, the elderly, and those who suffer from respiratory disease. The total health cost was estimated to be more than $100 billion per year [41].

Coal-fired power plants are the largest source of mercury emissions to the air in the United States [42, 43]. As airborne mercury settles onto the ground, it washes into bodies of water where it accumulates in fish, and subsequently passes through the food chain to birds and other animals. The consumption of mercury-laden fish by pregnant women has been associated with neurological and neurobehavioral effects in infants. Young children are also at risk [44].

A number of studies have sought to quantify the health costs associated with fossil fuel-related air pollution. The National Academy of Sciences assessed the costs of SO2, NOx, and particulate matter air pollution from coal and reported an annual cost of $62 billion for 2005 —approximately 3.2 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) [45]. A separate study estimated that the pollution costs from coal combustion, including the effects of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ozone, was approximately $187 billion annually, or 9.3 cents per kWh [46].

A 2013 study also assessed the economic impacts of fossil fuel use, including illnesses, premature mortality, workdays lost, and direct costs to the healthcare system associated with emissions of particulates, NOx, and SO2. This study found an average economic cost (or “public health added cost”) of 32 cents per kWh for coal, 13 cents per kWh for oil, and 2 cents per kWh for natural gas [47]. While cost estimates vary depending on each study’s scope and assumptions, together they demonstrate the significant and real economic costs that unpriced air emissions impose on society.

Fossil fuel transportation emissions represent the largest single source of toxic air pollution in the U.S., accounting for over a third of carbon monoxide (CO) and NOx emissions.

Water use
Across the United States, the demand for electricity is colliding with the need for healthy and abundant freshwater. Nationwide, fossil fuel and nuclear power plants have been found to withdraw as much water as all farms and more than four times as much as all residences. More than 80 percent of this power plant cooling water originates in lakes and rivers, directly impacting local ecosystems and often competing with other uses, such as agriculture and recreation. As of 2008, about 20 percent of U.S. watersheds were experiencing water-supply stress. Power plants substantially contributed to the water stress in one-fifth of these watersheds [48].

Power plants that return water to nearby rivers, lakes, or the ocean can harm wildlife through what is known as “thermal pollution.” Thermal pollution occurs due to the degradation of water quality resulting from changes in water temperature. Some power plants have large impacts on the temperature of nearby water sources, particularly coal plants with once-through cooling systems. For a typical 600-megawatt once-through system, 70 to 180 billion gallons of water cycle through the power plant before being released back into a nearby source. This water is much hotter (by up to 25°F) than when the water was initially withdrawn. Because this heated water contains lower levels of dissolved oxygen, its reintroduction to aquatic ecosystems can stress native wildlife, increasing heart rates in fish and decreasing fish fertility."
"The world relies on burning fossil fuels to create the majority of its energy. While fossil fuels provide an inexpensive and efficient way to produce power, large amounts of greenhouse gases are produced during fossil fuel combustion. 

We will explore the process of burning fossil fuels and look at why they are burned and what sectors use the energy they supply. Then, we will cover what sort of products and greenhouse gases are released when fossil fuels are burned. Finally, we’ll view alternative energy solutions that are available for energy production. 

What Are Fossil Fuels? 
Most of the fossil fuels we exploit today are the product of plants and animals that died 540 million to 65 million years ago and were buried in layers of sediment. Over time, the fossils were subjected to increased pressure and heat as the sedimentary rock layers of the earth’s crust continued to develop above them.  

Eventually, these fossils turned into kerogen, also known as oil shale. After even more time, the oil shale was subjected to even greater temperatures and ultimately transformed into coal, oil, or natural gas. Fossil fuels consist of energy stores called hydrocarbons that form during exposure to immense heat and pressure. 

What Is Fossil Fuel Combustion? 
Fossil fuel combustion is the process of burning coal, oil, natural gases, or other fossil fuels to create energy. The use of fossil fuels creates around 80% of the world’s energy. While these fuels are an inexpensive way to produce power, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases when combusted. 

Creating electricity through burning fossil fuels utilizes a steam generator to create power. Fossil fuels are burned to heat water in boilers that make large amounts of steam. High pressure from the steam then rotates a turbine in a steam generator and creates power. This power is then transferred into the power supply. 

Other forms of fossil fuel combustion come from the transportation sector. Burning fuel to power cars, trucks, and airplanes are all forms of fossil fuel combustion.

What Happens When You Burn Fossil Fuels?  
Due to the presence of hydrocarbons, fossil fuels produce a substantial amount of energy per pound when combusted. Hydrocarbon-rich fossil fuels hold a large amount of energy potential that is released in the form of heat when combusted in the presence of oxygen. 

However, these hydrocarbons also produce large amounts of carbon dioxide, which contributes to the greenhouse effect and in turn causes global warming. As the hydrocarbon compounds break down during combustion, the carbon dioxide is released alongside the heat energy. 

Why Are Fossil Fuels Burned? 
Burning Fossil Fuels | Energy Plant Burning Fossil Fuelssource

Burning fossil fuels creates energy in many different ways for people worldwide. Fossil fuels are responsible for powering the energy sector, transportation sector, and industrial sector. 

In the energy sector, people rely on electricity generation for lighting, heating, and cooling in their homes and places of business. In 2020, 60.6% of all electricity in the United States was generated from burning fossil fuels. Natural gas is also commonly used in homes and commercial buildings for heating, cooking, and other needs. 

Fossil fuels are also used to power the transportation sector. In 2020, the U.S. transportation sector received 89% of its energy from petroleum fuel sources. People rely on personal vehicles, public transportation, and air travel to get where they need to be. Many of these modes of transportation rely on burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuels also power the transportation of goods around the world. Cargo ships, trucks, and airplanes are often powered with petroleum fuels.  

Finally, the industrial sector relies on fossil fuels to create heat for their industrial practices and to create power to manufacture products. The industrial sector uses energy generated by burning fossil fuels to power electrical equipment like motors, lights, computers, and more. The manufacturing industry is responsible for using the most energy within the industrial sector.  

What Do Fossil Fuels Release When Burned? 
Six products are released due to the burning of fossil fuels. Each of these products affects the environment in different ways. 

Carbon Dioxide 
Of all the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide is the most abundant when it comes to human-related emissions. Carbon dioxide is released in large quantities from burning coal, gas, and oil because these fuels are primarily composed of hydrocarbons released in the form of carbon dioxide once combusted. Coal burning is the primary source of carbon dioxide emissions, followed by burning oil, then natural gas. 

Carbon Monoxide 
Carbon monoxide is released when carbon-based fuel is not completely burned. The primary source of carbon monoxide emissions comes from road vehicles. Non-road vehicles, like boats or construction equipment, also contribute to carbon monoxide emissions.  

Sulfur Dioxide 
Sulfur dioxide is found in coal and oil. It can be emitted when these fossil fuels are burned and through the process of extracting gasoline from crude oil. When sulfur dioxide dissolves into water vapor and forms sulfuric acid, it interacts with other gases in the air, and sulfates are formed. This can lead to acid rain.

Nitrogen Oxides 
Nitrogen oxides are released when fossil fuels are burned at high temperatures in motor vehicles or from other fuel-burning sources in industrial or home settings. Nitrogen dioxide, one common form of nitrogen oxide, creates smog over city centers. 

Lead 
Lead used to be a more common emission when leaded gasoline was used for vehicles. Today, most lead pollutants can be found in the air around factories that separate metal from ore. 

Particulate Matter 
Particulate matter is any solid particle or liquid droplet found in the air. Particulate matter is released when fossil fuels are burned and can be found in higher concentrations in regions that burn more fuels, like city centers or power facilities. 

Why Is Burning Fossil Fuels a Problem? 
Burning Fossil Fuels | City View Factories in Distancesource

The primary issue associated with burning fossil fuels is that the practice releases large quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. High concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increase the global temperature and cause climate change.  

Carbon dioxide is the most emitted greenhouse gas, accounting for 65% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Burning fossil fuels is the activity responsible for emitting the most carbon dioxide around the world. 

As the world continues to rely on fossil fuels for energy production and transportation, carbon emissions will continue to remain high. If the globe does not mitigate the amounts of carbon dioxide released by burning fossil fuels, then we will continue to see increasing global temperatures and climate change. 

What Are 3 Effects of Burning Fossil Fuels? 
There are three adverse effects of burning fossil fuels: air pollution, water pollution, and climate change. These effects are caused by the products released when fossil fuels are burned. 

Air Pollution 
Air pollution occurs when products like sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter are released from burning fossil fuels. Air pollution has been found to cause respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Children, pregnant women, and elderly people are all at higher risk of the negative health effects caused by air pollution. 

Water Pollution 
Water pollution occurs when sulfur dioxide dissolves into water and creates sulfuric acid. This produces acid rain and can lead to the acidification of freshwater sources like lakes and streams. When these bodies of water become too acidic, life cannot survive in them. Acid rain can also affect local crops and soil acidity levels. 

Climate Change 
Climate change is a significant threat to ecosystems and human populations worldwide. Carbon dioxide emitted through burning fossil fuels plays a huge role in global warming. As more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, more heat is trapped on earth through the greenhouse effect. Increasing global temperatures can lead to rising sea levels, deforestation, changing climates, and scarcity of food sources.  

Which Fossil Fuel Is the Cleanest Burning? 
Of the three primary fossil fuels, the cleanest burning fuel is natural gas. Using natural gas to generate energy emits less of all kinds of air pollutants and carbon dioxide than both oil and coal. 

While natural gas is cleaner to burn for energy, it consists primarily of methane, a harmful greenhouse gas. Natural gas leaks are a leading cause of methane emissions each year in the United States. What is more, the process of locating natural gas wells and drilling for natural gas can have negative environmental impacts.

What Are Alternatives to Burning Fossil Fuels? 
Alternatives to burning fossil fuels include renewable energy sources like hydroelectricity, wind power, and solar energy. Clean energy from nuclear power plants is another alternative to burning fossil fuels. 

The benefit of transitioning to clean energy is a significant reduction in emissions. Nuclear energy and renewable energy sources have no emissions, which can slow the effect of climate change around the world. 

A switch to entirely renewable energy systems would provide the best alternative to fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are non-renewable, meaning once the natural resource is diminished, we will not be able to continue using it. On the other hand, sustainable energy sources provide us with a supply we can never run out of, meaning increased energy security for future generations. 

Burning Fossil Fuels? Only for the Time Being 
Burning Fossil Fuels | Energy Grid Solar Renewable Solutionssource

Burning fossil fuels provides the majority of global energy. However, this natural resource is not sustainable and releases many harmful emissions when it is burned. While fossil fuels are cheap and efficient, the globe should move forward to find better solutions on how to create energy. That way, we can avoid the negative effects that come along with burning fossil fuels while still providing the energy our planet relies on. 

In the meantime, while the world energy system is still dependent on fossil fuels, you can make a difference by participating in carbon offsetting programs. These programs are designed to mitigate the carbon released from activities that burn fossil fuels. 
For example, if you are taking a flight somewhere, you can purchase carbon offset credits that go toward projects that support reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Visit Terrapass today and view all of our carbon offset programs for individuals and businesses. "
"he combustion of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum [oil], and natural gas) is the major source of both air pollution and the greenhouse-gas emissions driving climate change. The fetus, infant, and child are especially vulnerable to exposure to air pollution and climate change, which are already taking a major toll on the physical and mental health of children. Given the frequent co-occurrence of various fossil-fuel exposures, their interactions and cumulative environmental impacts are a growing concern. All children are at risk, but the greatest burden falls on those who are socially and economically disadvantaged. Protection of children’s health requires that health professionals understand the multiple harms to children from climate change and air pollution and use available strategies to reduce these harms.

Consequences of Fossil-Fuel Emissions
Figure 1.

Emission Sources and Trends.
Worldwide, in recent years, billions of tons of carbon dioxide and more than 120 million metric tons of methane, the two key greenhouse gases, have been emitted annually into the atmosphere from the production and burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation.1 Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have risen sharply in the past 70 years, reaching 35 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted in 2020, as compared with just 5 billion metric tons in 1950.2 Figure 1 shows the need for deep reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions and the sharp increase in fossil-fuel–based energy consumption in the United States.

Largely as a result of fossil-fuel emissions, the average surface temperature of the earth has increased by approximately 1.1°C (2°F) since preindustrial times.4 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has concluded that urgent action is required in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F) above preindustrial levels and to minimize the most catastrophic consequences.4 We are on track to reach this threshold within the next two decades and, with current climate policies, to have an increase in temperature of 2.5 to 2.9°C above preindustrial levels by the end of the century.3 Although an increase of more than 1.5°C appears to be locked in within the next two decades, we can change the trajectory after that by taking immediate action.4,5 Citing the devastating effects on health, 200 health journals, including the Journal, recently called on world leaders to take emergency action on climate change.6

The combustion of fossil fuels has created a parallel crisis of air pollution, because the burning of these fuels releases massive amounts of airborne fine respirable particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 ?m or less (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), mercury, and volatile chemicals that form ground-level ozone. One billion children worldwide are exposed to very high levels of air pollution.7 Fortunately, solutions are now available to substantially reduce, and in some cases eliminate, these emissions.8

Vulnerabilities of Children to Effects of Climate Change
Figure 2.

Susceptibilities in Fetuses, Infants, and Children Associated with Climate Change and Exposures.
The fetus, infant, and child are uniquely vulnerable to climate-related environmental impacts and air pollution owing to a host of biologic and behavioral factors.9-11 The speed of development and the elaborate developmental programming during these stages confer high susceptibility to disruption by toxic chemicals and other stressors. In addition, the biologic defense mechanisms for detoxifying chemicals, repairing DNA damage, and providing immune protection are immature in the infant and child, thus heightening their vulnerability to psychosocial stress and physical toxicants (Figure 2).

To support their rapid growth, the infant and child have greater nutritional and fluid requirements than adults and, therefore, a greater vulnerability to food and water supply disruptions. Infants and children breathe more air relative to their body weight than adults, which increases their exposure to air pollutants, and their narrower airways are vulnerable to constriction by air pollution and allergens.

Infants and children are more vulnerable than adults to severe heat because of their compromised thermoregulatory function at extreme temperatures13 and their dependence on care by adults who may be unaware of the risks, as when infants left in cars have died from the heat. Children also spend more time outdoors engaged in physical activity than adults.

Children are especially vulnerable to the effects of displacement due to weather disasters; they are prone to physical injury and psychological trauma as a result of being forced to leave their homes. Finally, children have a long remaining lifetime during which early illnesses such as asthma or mental health conditions may persist, affecting health and functioning in adulthood.

Effects of Climate Change
Table 1.

Exposure Pathways and Selected Associated Effects on Children’s Health.
Climate change is a threat multiplier for infants and children,14 acting through multiple pathways. Climate change has worldwide effects on health; nearly every child around the world is considered to be at risk from at least one climate hazard (Figure 2 and Table 1).7

EXTREME HEAT
Heat waves (defined as ?2 days of unusually hot weather) are increasing in frequency and intensity; modeling indicates that some heat waves would be extraordinarily unlikely to occur in the absence of climate change.34 Exposure to heat waves during in utero development is associated with increased risks of preterm birth and low birth weight; hyperthermia and death among infants; and heat stress, kidney disease, and other illnesses among children.16,35 In the United States, heat-related illness is a leading and increasing cause of death and illness among student athletes. Studies suggest that heat associated with climate change has adverse effects on the mental health of children and adolescents, including increased mental health–related emergency department visits; such extreme heat also affects children’s ability to learn.36,37

CLIMATE-INTENSIFIED EXTREME EVENTS
Climate change has intensified major floods and hurricanes, which have caused drowning, physical injury, and traumatic stress in children.34 Risks from extreme weather events are greatest in low- and middle-income countries. Climate-related events have already contributed to more than 50 million children worldwide being forced to leave their homes.38,39 In the United States, however, more than 900,000 displacements, many of them involving children, occurred in 2020 as a result of disasters.40 Children in low-income communities and communities of color are disproportionately harmed by these events. Effects may include disruption of education and mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.41

WILDFIRE SMOKE AND AEROALLERGENS
As a result of climate change, the western United States has had dramatic increases in forest fires in recent years.42 An estimated 7.4 million children in the United States were exposed to lung-damaging wildfire smoke every year between 2008 and 2012.42 This number has increased in recent years as large forest fires in the western United States have become even more frequent. Exposure to wildfire smoke in utero has been linked to decreased birth weight and preterm birth; exposures in childhood are associated with asthma exacerbations, wheeze, pneumonia, and bronchitis.43

Children are also having more allergy and asthma attacks from increased levels of airborne pollen as a result of higher temperatures and rising levels of carbon dioxide, which have resulted in longer growing seasons and increased pollen production.44-46 The proliferation of mold in homes from excess moisture due to heavy rains and flooding, as occurred in the New Orleans area during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, can trigger an asthma attack regardless of whether the child has a mold allergy.46

DECREASED FOOD AND WATER SUPPLY AND SAFETY
Droughts that are related in part to climate change have affected Central and South America, Afghanistan and other parts of Asia, Australia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the southeastern United States.34 In developing countries, the resulting food insecurity has led to a sharp increase in malnutrition, which has caused stunting of children’s physical and mental development, with associated behavioral and cognitive problems. In addition to the environmental impacts of climate-related drought on the food supply itself, increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide have been linked to a reduction in the nutritional quality of major cereal crops.12

Risks associated with food and water safety are experienced worldwide. Children, especially infants, are particularly susceptible to gastrointestinal infection caused by bacterial pathogens such as salmonella in food and water; these infections are more frequent at higher ambient temperatures that promote bacterial replication.47 Children are also more susceptible than adults to cholera and other infectious diarrheal diseases owing to crop and water contamination from storms and floods.48

CHANGE IN VECTOR ECOLOGY
Climate change is associated with increased risks of several vectorborne diseases, including malaria, dengue, Zika virus infection, and Lyme disease, in certain regions owing to changes in the duration of the transmission season and the geographic spread of the disease vectors.49 The geographic ranges of the species of mosquitoes that carry malaria (anopheles) and dengue (aedes) have expanded because of warmer temperatures. The effect on health is greatest among children in tropical regions; however, small local outbreaks of dengue have been seen in Florida, Hawaii, and Texas.50 The aedes mosquito is also the primary carrier of the Zika virus, which was responsible for the 2015–2016 outbreak in the Americas, including travel-associated cases in the United States.51 Cases of local transmission of Zika virus occurred in Florida and Texas in the 2016–2017 period. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly, severe brain malformation, and other birth defects.

The United States has also had a marked increase in the incidence of Lyme disease, with the highest rates occurring among children.52 Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Virginia, and western Pennsylvania have all reported an increase in the number of cases of Lyme disease over the past few decades.53

Effects of Air Pollution
Air pollution is a well-known trigger of asthma attacks in children with the disease and is now understood to be a cause of asthma.54 It is also a risk factor for respiratory infections, bronchitis, and impaired lung growth and function.55 A study showed that children with higher exposure to air pollution had more severe asthma symptoms and lower levels of regulatory T cells — factors that play a critical role in controlling allergic diseases such as asthma — than children from a less-polluted area.56

Air pollution is strongly associated with increased risks of infant death and adverse birth outcomes.9 Worldwide, an estimated 2 million preterm births in 2019 were attributed to ambient PM2.5 exposure.24 Although most of these preterm births occur in lower- and middle-income countries, PM2.5 exposure is a recognized risk factor for preterm birth and low birth weight in the United States.57 These birth complications confer increased risks of lower respiratory infections, other infectious diseases, and asthma in childhood, as well as long-term intellectual disabilities.

Prenatal and postnatal exposure to various air pollutants has also been associated with reduced cognition, attention problems, attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder, and autistic traits in childhood.18,58 Studies have shown structural and functional changes in the brains of children who had elevated exposure to air pollutants before birth or during childhood.19,59

Recent epidemiologic research indicates that air pollution is also a risk factor for mental health conditions in children and adolescents. For example, lifetime exposure to traffic-related air pollution in Cincinnati was associated with depression and anxiety symptoms in 12-year-old children.20 In a London-based cohort, children who were exposed to higher levels of outdoor air pollution had increased odds of major depressive disorder at 18 years of age.22

Interactions of Air Pollution and Climate Change
Environmental and epidemiologic data indicate that air pollutants and climate change interact to affect children’s health. Joint occurrence of air pollution, heat, and other climate-related changes has led to worse air quality. Air stagnation and higher temperatures accelerate the formation of ozone, which is associated with respiratory illness in children and with preterm birth. Concentrations of PM2.5 have increased in some areas because of changes in temperature, precipitation frequency, and air stagnation due to climate change. Wildfires, which have been made more frequent and severe by climate change, release vast amounts of particulate matter, PAH, and black carbon, thus adding to the ambient load from fossil-fuel burning. In addition, air pollutants can increase allergen absorption in the lungs and promote sensitization of the airway.60

There is evidence of a synergistic effect of heat and air pollution on the incidence of hospitalization related to childhood asthma.61 More studies on child health outcomes are needed; however, a large epidemiologic study showed a synergistic effect of prenatal exposure to heat and air pollution on the risk of preterm birth.62

Concurrent exposure to climate hazards and unsafe air quality is common. An estimated 850 million children — or 1 in 3 children worldwide — live in areas where at least four climate and environmental shocks, such as severe drought, flooding, air pollution, and water scarcity, overlap.63 Therefore, cumulative effects are likely, such as when children have concurrent exposure to air pollution, extreme temperatures, food insecurity, and social stress from climate change.

Of particular concern are the cumulative effects of air pollution and climate change on mental health. Adverse experiences in childhood, such as disasters and displacement, not only raise the short-term risk of mental disorders but also confer a lasting vulnerability to anxiety, depression, and mood disorders in adulthood.64 Even in the absence of direct experience of effects of climate change, stress due to the awareness of climate change and its effects (termed climate change anxiety) can increase the risk of mental health problems among children and young people. In a survey across 10 countries, nearly 60% of young persons said that they felt very worried or extremely worried about climate change; more than 45% said that their feelings about climate change negatively affected their daily lives.65

Disparities
All children are at risk from air pollution and climate change, but there are substantial inequities according to income and race. Disparities are most obvious between higher- and lower-income countries but are also evident within the United States, where children in low-income communities and in certain racial and ethnic groups, such as Black and Hispanic children, have disproportionate exposure to air pollution66 and to the effects of climate change.67 Contributing factors include the siting of polluting sources in or near disadvantaged neighborhoods and a lack of adequate nutrition, health care, education, and social support. Risks from heat waves are greater in low-income communities of color, where discriminatory policies such as redlining have created urban heat islands (characterized by heat-trapping asphalt, few trees, dense concentration of buildings, traffic, industry, and highways) and where resources to protect children from heat are fewer.68 Similarly, disadvantaged children have been disproportionately affected by severe storms, such as Hurricanes Katrina (in 2005) in Louisiana and Harvey (in 2017) in Louisiana and Texas.69

Climate change and air pollution are exacerbating existing socioeconomic and racial and ethnic inequities in children’s health that are associated with structural racism. For example, in the United States, the preterm birth rate is more than 50% higher among Black women than among White women; for childhood asthma, the rate among Black children is more than double that among White children.70,71 Black children have had a higher rate of pediatric emergency department visits for mental health than White children.72 In a situation with global warming of 2.0°C, Black persons are approximately one third more likely than White persons to live in areas with the highest projected increases in childhood asthma diagnoses, a factor that is attributable to higher concentrations of particulate air pollution that has been linked to climate change.67 In addition, low-income children have a 15% higher projected increase in the incidence of asthma diagnoses than non–low-income children.73

Population-Level Strategies for Mitigation and Adaptation
The solutions that are briefly described in this section are largely framed as climate and environmental strategies; however, they should also be seen as essential public health policy. There is a need for simultaneous action on two fronts: to protect children today from climate hazards (adaptation) and to attack the root problem by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and strengthening natural carbon sinks (mitigation). Adaptation measures include the provision of clean water to children and families facing drought and water contamination; early-warning systems for flooding and air pollution; disaster-response training and evacuation planning for families and children; shaded areas where children play, live, and go to school; and mosquito nets to protect children from malaria and dengue. To address inequality, these climate-specific measures must be paired with broad social programs to reduce poverty and to provide water, sanitation, hygiene services, high-quality health care, and education.

Table 2.

Examples of Climate Change–Mitigation Strategies and Projected Effects on Children’s Health and Other Outcomes.
Effective strategies are available and are being implemented in various parts of the world to mitigate climate change and reduce air pollution. Such strategies include federal, state, or local policies that facilitate a shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, boosting natural carbon sequestration, and strengthening the social safety net.8 Although data from randomized clinical trials to assess the effect of such strategies on children’s health are largely lacking, data from observational and modeling studies indicate substantial projected health benefits to children and associated economic savings of some mitigation and adaptation strategies for climate change and air pollution (e.g., reducing emissions, changing to ultra-low-diesel school buses, and tree planting) (Table 2). Governmental policies that have directly targeted emissions from fossil-fuel burning can both benefit children’s health and be cost-saving. For example, between 2009 and 2014, the reduction in ambient PM2.5 as a result of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern United States was estimated to have prevented more than 16,000 cases of respiratory illness, 537 new cases of asthma, and other illness in children, with substantial cost savings.75

Implications for Clinical Practice and Public Health
Health professionals caring for children need to understand the health harms of climate change and air pollution in order to effectively counsel children and their families on risk-reduction strategies. The American Board of Pediatrics has a Maintenance of Certification module on climate, health, and equity and is the first board to offer such content. Some medical schools and residency training programs have added curricula that address climate change–related risks among children and pregnant women; in some cases, they include opportunities to teach mitigation and adaptation techniques to the local pediatric population (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).

Table 3.

Suggested Practice Recommendations to Minimize Fossil Fuel–Related Health Risks among Children.
Guidance is available to help in identifying persons at particular risk from climate change or air pollution on the basis of assessments of underlying illness (e.g., asthma), geographic location (e.g., proximity to air pollution sources, urban heat islands, or flooding), and mental health burdens (e.g., anxiety after being forced to relocate after a wildfire) (Table 3 and S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Given the recognition that long-term exposure to air pollution causes childhood diseases such as asthma,54 there is now a clinical code for air-pollution exposure (Z77.110) in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision.

Patient-Level Interventions
Table 3 provides practical guidance for pediatricians and other health professionals caring for children with respect to screening, treatment, and counseling regarding adaptation strategies. Suggested behavioral changes need to take into account the socioeconomic status of children so that the changes are actionable and durable and empower the child and family rather than making them feel powerless, afraid, or guilty. We recommend that, in parallel with these screening assessments, health care professionals work with pediatric patients and families to implement interventions, to build their awareness of the harmful effects of climate change and pollutants, to actively motivate them to change their behaviors to protect their own health while lowering their carbon emissions, and to provide guidance on avoiding and managing various harms (e.g., heat).78

Future Needs and Directions
Climate change continues to demand better health care systems and improved access to mitigation and adaptation plans for hundreds of millions of children and pregnant women around the world. Rigorous physiological and epidemiologic data exist that link climate change with multiple effects on health. However, further research is needed in order to better understand the range of short- and long-term effects on children’s physical and mental health of climate-change pathways and air-pollution exposure (e.g., longitudinal studies to evaluate longer term effects of displacement and stress that are due to extreme climate–related events in childhood), to monitor and measure sustained health effects in children and pregnant women that have been associated with various mitigation and adaptation strategies (e.g., research into health outcomes in children in households that use only electricity, as compared with gas, for energy), and to study economic and quality-of-life outcomes (e.g., cost-effectiveness analyses that take into account reductions in hospitalizations and other medical expenses for children or pregnant women and are associated with strategies to reduce PM2.5 exposure). It is of paramount importance that research findings be rapidly translated into policies to protect and improve children’s and maternal health, with special focus on vulnerable populations.

Conclusions
The data are compelling that the toll on children and pregnant women from fossil-fuel–driven climate change and air pollution is large and growing, affecting immediate and long-term health. Interventions — which are, in many cases, cost-saving — exist to address the causes of climate change and air pollution and the disparities that they have created. Health professionals have the power to protect the children they care for by screening to identify those at high risk for associated health consequences; by educating them, their families, and others more broadly about these risks and effective interventions; and by advocating for strong mitigation and adaptation strategies."
"Fossil-fuel combustion by-products are the world’s most significant threat to children’s health and future and are major contributors to global inequality and environmental injustice. The emissions include a myriad of toxic air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the most important human-produced climate-altering greenhouse gas. Synergies between air pollution and climate change can magnify the harm to children. Impacts include impairment of cognitive and behavioral development, respiratory illness, and other chronic diseases—all of which may be “seeded“ in utero and affect health and functioning immediately and over the life course. By impairing children’s health, ability to learn, and potential to contribute to society, pollution and climate change cause children to become less resilient and the communities they live in to become less equitable. The developing fetus and young child are disproportionately affected by these exposures because of their immature defense mechanisms and rapid development, especially those in low- and middle-income countries where poverty and lack of resources compound the effects. No country is spared, however: even high-income countries, especially low-income communities and communities of color within them, are experiencing impacts of fossil fuel-related pollution, climate change and resultant widening inequality and environmental injustice. Global pediatric health is at a tipping point, with catastrophic consequences in the absence of bold action. Fortunately, technologies and interventions are at hand to reduce and prevent pollution and climate change, with large economic benefits documented or predicted. All cultures and communities share a concern for the health and well-being of present and future children: this shared value provides a politically powerful lever for action. The purpose of this commentary is to briefly review the data on the health impacts of fossil-fuel pollution, highlighting the neurodevelopmental impacts, and to briefly describe available means to achieve a low-carbon economy, and some examples of interventions that have benefited health and the economy.

1. Introduction
Children, and especially the poor, bear a disproportionate burden of disease and developmental impairment from both environmental pollution and climate change due to the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas. Assessments of the health and economic costs of the impacts of fossil-fuel combustion by-products on children have typically been fragmented, published in specialized journals and have separately considered air pollution and climate change. This silo effect has precluded a full reckoning of the harm to children that results from a carbon-based economy and has stymied the advancement of properly comprehensive policies to protect this vulnerable group. This commentary calls for a holistic accounting of the harm from fossil-fuel burning. Such an accounting is needed to spur the required global mitigation and action to reduce disparities between regions and socioeconomic classes and address the growing threat to future generations. Unless we act forcefully right now, our children and theirs will inherit an unsustainable world, lacking the essential ecological resources and social stability to support them. A major theme of this commentary is environmental injustice: the disproportionately heavy health and economic burden that falls on the young, the poor, and certain minorities, especially those in developing countries who are most vulnerable to the impacts of toxic air pollutants as well as CO2-driven climate change resulting from the combustion of fossil fuel. Alleviating this burden would bring great and lasting benefits to children and their progeny. In his Encyclical, Laudate Si, Pope Francis concluded that global capitalism, based on the burning of fossil fuels, has created unsustainable consumption and mounting inequity. This warning was also sounded in the recent report of the Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change [1]. To paraphrase the Lancet Commission: government policies and other strategies to reduce dependence on fossil fuel and build sustainable communities represent the biggest opportunity of our century to improve public health, redress inequality and increase the resilience of individuals, communities and the broader society.

In a prior commentary [2], I envisioned fossil fuel as the modern day version of the many-headed Hydra in Greek mythology, inflicting multiple forms of health and developmental harm in children through its emissions of toxic pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2). Were we to slay the hydra by transitioning to sustainable and renewable energy sources for transport, electricity generation, and industry, we would reap lasting benefits for children. These include significantly fewer cases of babies born preterm or with low birth weight, children with cognitive and behavioral disorders, mental-health problems, asthma and other respiratory illness, and potentially cardiovascular disease and cancer—all of which have been linked to toxic air pollutants. Mitigation of climate change would mean fewer children suffering from heat-related disease, malnutrition, infectious disease, physical and psychological trauma, mental-health problems, and respiratory illness. All of these health benefits would occur immediately and play out over the life course, since exposure-related damage, disease, or impairment in early life can affect long-term health and functioning. Of growing concern are the adverse effects on early brain development, impairing children’s ability to learn, hence their future economic productivity and ability to contribute ideas and energy to society. As a result, they, their families and the broader community are less resilient (“able to survive, adapt, and grow in the face of stress and shocks and transform when conditions require”) [3]. Society becomes even less fair, since the children who are most affected are the poor and disadvantaged.

This commentary builds upon a prior review by this author that contains more detail and references [2], updating it with more recent or additional scientific and economic data on the current and projected health impacts of fossil-fuel combustion. A major focus here is on the neurodevelopmental impacts of air toxics and climate change and their combination, because heretofore the effects on the developing brain have been less recognized than the other health impacts of these exposures.

2. The Young Are Especially Vulnerable to Air Pollution and Climate Change
The developing fetus and young child are more biologically and psychologically vulnerable than adults to the many adverse effects of toxic air pollutants and climate change from fossil-fuel combustion. This differential susceptibility is due to their rapid growth, dynamic developmental programming, immature detoxification, immune, and thermoregulatory systems, and their dependence on adult caretakers. The complexity of early development conveys vulnerability to disruption by toxic exposures of all kinds, including toxic pollutants and stress. Like the respiratory and immune systems, the brain continues to develop during infancy through childhood; however, the prenatal period is considered to be the most dynamic. For example, between conception and birth the brain undergoes highly synchronized maturation from the initial formation of the neural tube to the proliferation and migration of the neurons, synaptogenesis, apoptosis or “pruning” of synapses, and the early phase of myelination [4]. Most of the more than 86 billion neurons of the mature brain are formed during the prenatal period [5]. Numerous studies demonstrate that the fetal and early childhood stages are especially vulnerable to both genetic damage and epigenetic dysregulation from exposure to xenobiotics and stress; these molecular effects may have lifelong and transgenerational consequence [6,7,8].

In addition, because children breathe more air per kilogram of body weight than do adults and require three to four times the amount of food on a body-weight basis than adults, they are more exposed to pollutants in air and food [9,10]. Testifying to the differential vulnerability of the young, the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that more than 40% of the burden of environmentally related disease and more than 88% of the burden of climate change is borne by children under 5, although that age group constitutes only 10% of the global population [11,12,13]. The most serious impacts of climate change are occurring in developing countries; however, the entire global population is affected.

Go to:
3. Fossil-Fuel Combustion is the Major Source of Global Air Pollution and CO2
Globally, the majority of air pollution is generated by the combustion of fossil fuel (coal, diesel fuel, gasoline, oil, and natural gas) for electricity production, heating, transportation, and industry [14]. Worldwide, in 2011, fossil fuels represented 82% of the total primary energy supply [15]. In the US, oil, natural gas, and coal account for 81% of current fuel use [16]. Energy-related fossil-fuel combustion in high- and middle-income countries and biomass burning in low-income countries accounts for most of the global air pollution, generating 85% of airborne respirable particulate pollution and almost all sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions to the atmosphere [17]. Also emitted are black carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nitrogen and sulfur dioxides, mercury, and volatile chemicals that form ground-level ozone (O3). All are associated with multiple adverse health effects in children.

Air pollution affects practically all countries in the world and all parts of society; only one person in 10 lives in a city that complies with the WHO Air quality guidelines [18]. Household air pollution is an important risk factor for an estimated 2.9 billion people worldwide, especially those in low- and middle-income countries where biomass fuels and coal are commonly burned for cooking and heating [19] In total, about 2 billion children live in areas that exceed the WHO annual guideline for fine particles of 10 ?g/m3 (the concentration of fine particulate matter that constitutes a long-term inhalation hazard) [20]. About 300 million children currently live in areas where outdoor air pollution exceeds international guidelines at least six-fold [21]. These guidelines are likely underestimates, since recent epidemiological studies have reported impacts below these levels.

Globally, although it remains a very important risk, indoor air pollution has been on the decline in recent years due largely to the reduction in use of solid fuels for cooking from around 60% of homes in 1980 to 42% in 2012 [22]. In contrast, ambient air pollution has shown a dramatic rise. Urban ambient air pollution increased by about 8% between 2008 and 2013; and the upward trend is projected to continue [21].

Fossil-fuel combustion is also the major human source of the greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants that drive climate change. As stated in a recent US interagency report: “Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are primarily responsible for the observed climate changes in the industrial era, especially over the last six decades” [23]. Human activities emit about 35 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, primarily from energy use [24]. The Annual Greenhouse Gas Index, which is used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to track the warming influence of long-lived climate-altering greenhouse gases, increased by 40% from 1990 to 2016, with most of that increase attributable to rising CO2 levels [25]. CO2 levels in the atmosphere are at their highest in 800,000 years [26]. In the US, coal and natural gas are the largest contributors to carbon pollution (constituting a third of all domestic carbon emissions). Methane released by production of natural gas, oil, and coal is second in importance. Although natural gas emits significantly less toxic air pollution and CO2 than the other fossil fuels [27], the drilling, extraction, and transportation of natural gas results in the leakage of methane that is 34 times more effective than CO2 at trapping heat over a 100-year period [28]. Given its increasing share of total fuel use, natural gas is expected to surpass coal as a source of energy-related CO2 emissions in the US [29].

According to the International Energy Agency, worldwide growth in coal consumption is predicted to decline between 2015 and 2021 as developed countries continue to abandon coal as an energy source and China’s consumption plateaus. However, that decline will be offset by growing demand among emerging nations, particularly in India and south-east Asia. Based on the assumption of business as usual, the US Energy Information Administration predicts that coal will remain the second-largest energy source worldwide, following petroleum and other liquid fuels, until 2030; and from 2030 through 2040, it will be the third-largest energy source, surpassed only by liquid fuels and natural gas [30]. In the US and some other countries, carbon emissions from cars and trucks have exceeded carbon emissions from electric power [31].

4. Fossil-Fuel Combustion-Related Air Pollutants and Climate Change are a Major Cause of Environmental Injustice
A major environmental injustice is that children, who are dependent on adults and did not create the problems, bear the brunt of the impacts of air pollution and climate change. It is a further injustice that children in low- and middle-income countries as well as lower-income communities and communities of color in high-income countries like the US are disproportionately affected. Echoing an earlier WHO finding, the recent report of the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health, on which this author was a commissioner, stated that pollution in all its forms disproportionately affects the poor and marginalized in every country worldwide, with air pollution being the largest contributor to pollution-related deaths, mainly in low- and middle-income countries [32]. Low- and middle-income countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions had the greatest air pollution-related burden in 2012, with a total of 2.6 million deaths related to outdoor air pollution and 3.3 million deaths linked to indoor air pollution [33]. However, in contrast to pollution-related deaths, which largely occur among adults over 60, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) resulting from pollution-related disease are highly concentrated among infants and young children, reflecting the vulnerability of the young and the many years of life lost with each death of a child [34].

Two factors contribute to the socioeconomic disparities in the impacts of air pollution: differential exposure and heightened susceptibility. Globally, there is a notable pattern of disproportionate exposure of the poor and of certain racial/ethnic groups to air pollution. Studies have shown that low-income communities and communities of color in the US experience disproportionately high exposure to particulate air pollution and air pollution from coal-fired power plants [2]. A GIS-based study of over 150,000 children in the US found that the distribution of three stationary and mobile air-pollution sources followed a consistent pattern of racial inequity, with Hispanic and black children facing significantly higher levels of potential exposure than white children [35]. With respect to heightened susceptibility, an analysis of the Mexico City scenario concluded that low socioeconomic status (SES) children in that megacity are not only exposed to high levels of pollution buttend to have inadequate nutrition and deficient schools, and often face domestic, school and street violence . Because these co-factors make children more vulnerable to air toxins, the significant impact of high air pollution is likely affecting predominantly low SES children in Mexico City [36].

The same factors contribute to disparities in the impacts of climate change. It is the poor who are most often forced to live in areas that are especially vulnerable to extreme flooding, drought and other impacts of climate change. Poor children are also less buffered and less resilient in the face of climate change: “a child living in poverty or deprived of adequate water and sanitation before a crisis will be more affected by a flood, drought or storm, less likely to recover quickly and at even greater risk in a subsequent crisis” [37]. Pre-existing inadequate nutrition, lack of adequate social support, and psychosocial stress due to poverty magnify the effects of both climate change and air pollution. Worldwide, the number of children living in poverty is staggering: one billion children, almost half of the 2.2 billion children below 15 years of age, are living in poverty [38]. In the US, the world’s most prosperous country, the child poverty rate is a shocking 22%. As will be discussed, our research following parallel birth cohorts in the US and Poland has found that co-exposure of pregnant women to air pollution and social stress or hardship due to poverty significantly increases the adverse effect of air pollution on children’s IQ and behavioral problems including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [39,40,41]. For example, our research in Poland found evidence of significant interactions between maternal demoralization during pregnancy, itself correlated with material hardship, and prenatal air-pollution exposure on children’s behavioral problems [41]. In our NYC research, combined prenatal exposure to PAH and material hardship was associated with a significant reduction in the IQ of children [39].

5. The Health Impacts of Air Pollution in Children Include Mortality and Neurodevelopmental Problems
The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health [32] noted that air pollution remains one of the great killers of our age, echoing an earlier conclusion by the WHO that: “Air pollution, both ambient (outdoor) and household (indoor), is a public health emergency” and the biggest environmental risk to health. Most of the attention has been on excess mortality in the overall population, with the largest number of deaths in adults [33,42]. However, in children under 5 years’ old, 1.7 million deaths are attributed to pollution and environmental risks in general; with air pollution linked to 600,000 of these deaths each year, largely due to pneumonia [37,43]. Because of the increasing trend in outdoor air-pollution levels, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), under-5 mortality could be 50% higher than—or even double—current estimates by 2050 as a result of outdoor air pollution [22]. It is predicted that by 2050 outdoor air pollution will become the leading cause of child death [37]. However, millions more children are affected by chronic illness, including respiratory illness other than pneumonia and effects on physical and cognitive development [37].

A previous commentary by this author reviewed in some detail the documented effects of combustion-related air pollution on multiple outcomes including adverse birth outcomes, respiratory illness, and cancer [2]. Here the focus is on neurodevelopmental impacts, an area that has been under-recognized. Low birth weight and preterm birth will be briefly discussed in the context of child neurodevelopment.

A growing body of evidence indicates that early-life exposure to combustion-related air pollutants adversely affects children’s cognitive and behavioral development. There are inconsistencies in the results among studies that can be explained in part by differences in measures used and levels of air pollution, in race/ethnicity, potentially in susceptibility, and in methods to assess children’s neurodevelopment.

Particulate matter (PM) and traffic-related pollutants: Many studies have assessed the associations between PM or traffic-related air pollutants and cognitive outcomes in children from cohorts in the US, Europe and Asia [44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54]. The studies relied on estimates of exposure to PM or traffic-related pollutants (black carbon or nitrogen dioxide/NO2) largely based on land-use regression models, distance of the maternal residence during pregnancy to roadways, or traffic density. Although the results for PM have been mixed, most of the studies on traffic-related pollutant exposure have reported associations with decreased mental and psychomotor development. Several studies found that the two traffic-related pollutants were associated with reductions in children’s memory and IQ, after sociodemographic factors were taken into account [52,53]. Exposure to traffic pollution in childhood has also been linked to slower brain maturation [55].

With respect to attention problems, a study in Boston found more such problems with higher exposure to fine, respirable particulate matter having an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), during the sensitive periods of gestation, with differences between boys and girls [56]. Studies in South Korea and Japan also reported more attentional problems with higher prenatal exposure to PM or other pollutants [57,58]. The association with prenatal exposure to traffic-related air pollutants was not observed in German cohort studies; but there was a significant association between higher PM2.5 levels at the children’s current addresses and increased hyperactivity/inattention scores [45].

Air pollution, mainly PM2.5 or traffic-related pollution, has been associated in a number of studies with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [59,60,61,62,63]. In contrast, European studies reported no association with autistic traits [64,65]. Although studies have not all been consistent, there is growing evidence that prenatal exposure to traffic-related air pollutants and PM2.5 may be risk factors for ASD [66,67,68].

There is some evidence using molecular biomarkers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain that chronic exposure to airborne pollutants in the early years may contribute to neurodegenerative disease processes including Alzheimers’s disease [69,70]. In Mexico City, researchers have reported distinct brain changes that have been associated with adult neurodegenerative disease in children living in high air-pollution areas [69].

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH): PAH are a class of neurotoxic air pollutants that my colleagues and I have studied with respect to cognitive and behavioral outcomes and mood disorders in complementary cohort studies in New York City, Krakow, Poland and Chongqing, China [39,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88] In our NYC cohort, prenatal exposure to PAH measured by personal air-monitoring or biomarkers of PAH exposure in cord or maternal blood was associated with developmental delay, reduced IQ, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and inattention, ADHD, deficient maturation of emotional self–regulation capacity, and poorer social responsiveness in childhood. Significant interactions were observed between prenatal PAH and material hardship due to poverty on child IQ [39] and between prenatal PAH and maternal psychological distress on mood-related problems [2]. More recently, significant combined effects of PAH and material hardship have been observed on ADHD outcomes [40]. MRI brain imaging of a subset of children in the NYC cohort showed significant correlations between measures of prenatal PAH exposure and distinct anatomical changes [80].

An example of the neurodevelopmental benefits of reducing air-pollution levels is provided by our research in Tongliang, China, that compared a cohort born before the closure of a centrally located coal power plant to a cohort conceived after plant closure. The second cohort had more favorable birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, significantly lower cord blood levels of the biomarker of exposure measured in cord blood (PAH-DNA adducts), higher levels of a protein important in early brain development known as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and longer telomeres, a general marker of health [89,90].

In addition to their immediate toll, preterm birth and low birth weight are known risk factors for a number of neurodevelopmental disorders in children [91]. Recent studies confirm the reproductive effects of air pollution, their socioeconomic and racial disparities and the large cost imposed on affected families, furthering socioeconomic inequality and increasing the risk of neurodevelopmental effects in vulnerable populations. For example, a large prospective study in China found a significant increase in preterm birth with each 5 µg/m3 increase in maternal exposure to PM2.5 during the pregnancy [92]. A recent analysis found that about 2.7 million premature births per year (18% of preterm births) globally are associated with PM2.5 exposure, including from fossil-fuel and biomass burning, mostly in developing countries [93]. A recent multi-country study concluded that, across all study populations, maternal exposure to particulate pollution was associated with low birth weight at term [94]. Racial disparities exist. In the US, preterm birth rates are 7.4% among Non-Hispanic white infants compared to 17.2% for Non-Hispanic black infants. Both social and physical environmental factors contribute to these disparities [95]. These effects are costly to society and individuals. In the US alone, PM2.5 caused an estimated 15,000 preterm births in 2010, costing about $5 billion in medical care, special education services and lost economic productivity for that single year’s cohort [96].

6. Climate Change is Linked to Serious Health Impacts in Children Including Mortality and Developmental Impairment
As noted in the Introduction, references for this section can be found in [2]. Increased illness, injury, and deaths from heat stress, floods, drought, and increased frequency of forest fires and intense storms are among the direct effects of climate change. The indirect effects include malnutrition and under-nutrition, the spread of infectious-disease vectors, food insecurity, illness due to increased air pollution and aeroallergens, and mental ill health from displacement, social and political instability. Children are especially vulnerable to both the indirect and direct consequences of climate change.

There is broad scientific agreement that climate change has already taken a significant toll on children and that the impacts will increase dramatically unless forceful action is taken. The WHO estimated that climate change since the mid-1970s contributed to about 5 million lost DALYs world-wide in 2000 through malnutrition, diarrhea, and malaria, mostly in children and in developing countries. The toll is expected to rise to 175 million children affected each year in the next several years. These numbers are substantial underestimates since they reflect only a few of the health effects from climate change.

Children bearing the greatest burden of climate-sensitive diseases are those living in regions with the least capacity to adapt to risks—regions that have contributed the least in terms of global emissions of greenhouse gases. Although children in developing countries bear the brunt, the impacts of climate change are increasingly being seen in the US and Europe, especially among populations of low socioeconomic status.

Virtually all of the impacts of climate change can affect children’s neurodevelopment, cognitive functioning, behavior, and mental health, either directly or indirectly. Further, as with air pollution, the impacts are likely to be felt over the lifetime, affecting resilience, health and productivity. Climate change impacts the development of children’s brains in many ways. Malnutrition during the first 1000 days causes stunting of the brain and body, with associated reduced neurodevelopmental and cognitive function in children and subsequent decreased ability to learn and be economically productive [97]. In 2017, 155 million children under five (1 in 4 children) are stunted due to hunger [98].

Stress from extreme weather events also contributes to neurodevelopmental and mental health problems in children. Although no single extreme weather event, such as floods, droughts, wildfires, or hurricanes and cyclones, can be attributed directly to climate change, human-induced climate change is contributing to the frequency and severity of such events. Over the last several decades, there have also been more intense and frequent heat waves as well as marked regional changes in floods, droughts and wildfires in certain parts of the US and globally [99]. An estimated 66.5 million children world-wide were directly affected by weather-related disasters every year from 1990–2000, of whom 600,000 died. Sea-level rise due to global climate warming has made coastal storms increasingly dangerous for coastal infrastructure and inhabitants, contributing to deaths from drowning. Drowning is a major cause of fatality in children in developing countries. According to a recent study, rates of sea-level rise between 1993 and 2011 exceeded by 60% the highest projections made in 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In 2017, the NOAA estimated that the sea-level rise by the end of this century could reach as high as 6.5 feet, enough to inundate many waterfront cities around the globe [100]. Notable extreme weather events in the last decade include the massive flooding across south-east Asia in 2011 which affected an estimated 9.6 million people, many of them children [101]. In the US, Hurricane Katrina in 2005 forced 1 million people in New Orleans from their homes and left 372,000 children without schools; and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 affected people in 8 countries including 24 states in the US, with particularly severe damage in New Jersey and New York. Children who were affected by Hurricane Katrina were found to have higher rates of anxiety and depression [102]. Most recently, in September 2017 Hurricane Irma devastated islands in the Caribbean; and massive flooding in South Asia placed almost 16 million children in urgent need of life-saving support [103]. While populations of all economic statuses have been impacted, these events have most seriously affected the children in low-income communities.

The psychological and emotional impacts of climate change include the acute, traumatic effects of extreme weather events, mental and emotional distress resulting from direct experience or anxiety about future risks, chronic stress from heat, drought, forced migrations, and climate-related conflicts, and the stress of adjustment in the wake of weather-related disasters. Migration and population displacement as a result of social and political instability due to climate change affects the mental health of children in low-income, developing countries, contributing to the perpetuation of poverty and civil unrest. These countries, in which children less than 18 years’ old represent 50% of their population, already bear most of the global burden of poverty and childhood disease.

7. Prenatal or Childhood Exposure to Air Toxics and Climate Change Can Have Long-Term and Synergistic or Combined Health Impacts
By launching a trajectory of adverse effects following the initial physical or developmental impairment, and/or by “seeding” latent disease that only becomes evident in later life, toxic air pollutants can affect health and functioning over the life-course. For example, adverse reproductive outcomes associated with in utero environmental exposures are risk factors for neurodevelopmental, respiratory, and other health problems in infancy and childhood, as well as heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes in adulthood. As noted above, childhood ADHD and ASD have been associated with early-life exposure to air pollution; these disorders may persist into adulthood, affecting professional and personal life and increasing the costs of healthcare for individuals and families. There is empirical evidence that early childhood exposure to air pollution is linked to lower scores on IQ and other intelligence tests, with long-term economic consequences in terms of lifetime earnings.

"Natural gas is a relatively clean burning fossil fuel
Burning natural gas for energy results in fewer emissions of nearly all types of air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2) than burning coal or petroleum products to produce an equal amount of energy. About 117 pounds of CO2 are produced per million British thermal units (MMBtu) equivalent of natural gas compared with more than 200 pounds of CO2 per MMBtu of coal and more than 160 pounds per MMBtu of distillate fuel oil. The clean burning properties of natural gas have contributed to increased natural gas use for electricity generation and as a transportation fuel for fleet vehicles in the United States.

Natural gas is mainly methane—a strong greenhouse gas
Some natural gas leaks into the atmosphere from oil and natural gas wells, storage tanks, pipelines, and processing plants. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that in 2020, methane emissions from natural gas and petroleum systems and from abandoned oil and natural gas wells were the source of about 33% of total U.S. methane emissions and about 4% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.1 The oil and natural gas industry takes steps to prevent natural gas leaks. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that in 2021, U.S. CO2 emissions from natural gas combustion for energy accounted for about 34% of total U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions.

Natural gas exploration, drilling, and production affects the environment
When geologists explore for natural gas deposits on land, they may disturb vegetation and soil with their vehicles. Drilling a natural gas well on land may require clearing and leveling an area around the well site. Well drilling activities produce air pollution and may disturb people, wildlife, and water resources. Laying pipelines that transport natural gas from wells usually requires clearing land to bury the pipe. Natural gas production can also produce large volumes of contaminated water. This water requires proper handling, storage, and treatment so that it does not pollute land and other waters. Natural gas wells and pipelines often have engines to run equipment and compressors, which produce air pollutants and noise.

In areas where natural gas is produced at oil wells but is not economical to transport for sale or contains high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (a toxic gas), it is burned (flared) at well sites. Natural gas flaring produces CO2, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and many other compounds, depending on the chemical composition of the natural gas and on how well the natural gas burns in the flare. However, flaring is safer than releasing natural gas into the air and results in lower overall greenhouse gas emissions because CO2 is not as strong a greenhouse gas as methane.Advances in drilling and production technologies have positive and negative effects on the environment
New drilling and natural gas recovery technologies significantly reduce the land area that is disturbed to develop oil and gas resources. Horizontal and directional drilling techniques make it possible to produce more natural gas from a single well than in the past, so fewer wells are necessary to develop a natural gas field.

Hydraulic fracturing (commonly called hydrofracking, fracking, or fracing) of shale, sandstone, and carbonate rock formations is opening up large reserves of natural gas that were previously too expensive to develop. Fracking involves pumping liquids under high pressure into a well to fracture the rock, which allows natural gas to escape from the rock. Producing natural gas with this technique has some effects on the environment:

The fracturing of wells requires large amounts of water. In some areas of the country, significant use of water for fracking may affect aquatic habitats and the availability of water for other uses.
If mismanaged, hydraulic fracturing fluid—which may contain potentially hazardous chemicals—could be released through spills, leaks, faulty well construction, or other exposure pathways. These releases could contaminate surrounding areas.
Hydraulic fracturing produces large amounts of wastewater at the surface, which may contain dissolved chemicals and other contaminants that require treatment before disposal or reuse. Because of the quantities of water produced and the complexities inherent in treating some of the wastewater components, proper treatment and disposal of the wastewater is important.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, hydraulic fracturing ""...causes small earthquakes, but they are almost always too small to be a safety concern. In addition to natural gas, fracking fluids and formation waters are returned to the surface. These wastewaters are frequently disposed of by injection into deep wells. The injection of wastewater into the subsurface can cause earthquakes that are large enough to be felt and may cause damage.""
Natural gas could be released to the atmosphere during and after well drilling, and the amount of these releases are under investigation."
"Air pollution makes a major contribution to excess mortality from cardiovascular, respiratory, and other diseases (1–3). Significant excess death rates are related to fossil energy use, as combustion emissions from traffic, power generation, and industry typically occur in densely populated regions (4, 5). The Paris Agreement that aims to limit climate change in the 21st century to 1.5–2 °C above preindustrial levels requires the phaseout of fossil fuels, which may need to be augmented by negative emissions of CO2, i.e., removal from the atmosphere, or other geoengineering measures (6). Based on the two middle scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) there is an estimated 5% chance that the temperature increase in this century can be limited to 2 °C, but the likelihood increases when greenhouse gas emissions are curbed sharply in the near term (7). The timing of mitigation actions is critical, especially if currently unproven geoengineering options are to be avoided. Clearly, the switch from fossil to renewable, clean energy sources has the potential to prevent morbidity and mortality from aerosol pollution. Because the particles have a net climate cooling effect, removing them will lower the prospects of meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement, but the public health gain is nevertheless a strong motivation for emission controls (8, 9). Here we present the health benefits achieved by removing fossil-fuel-related and all air pollution emissions, applying hazard ratio functions that connect fine particulate matter to nonaccidental mortality (10). We consider the repercussions for climate change of policies and technologies which focus on air-quality improvement using traditional control methods such as filters, catalytic converters, and cleaner fuels, but also concurrently with greenhouse gas mitigation strategies which improve air quality.
Methods
We applied an atmospheric chemistry–general circulation model to calculate the impacts of air pollution on climate and public health (SI Appendix, SI Methods). The model comprehensively accounts for emissions, multiphase chemistry, and other processes that control atmospheric composition. Model results include concentrations of ozone (O3) and particulate matter, including PM2.5 (particulates with a diameter <2.5 µm), being the main cause of morbidity and mortality (2, 9). The results for PM2.5 and O3 served as input to the health impact calculations, based on the Global Burden of Disease methodology (2). We applied a Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) for PM2.5 that is based on an unmatched large number of cohort studies in many countries, and accounts for additional causes of death than considered previously (10). The GEMM calculations were complemented with those for O3, accounting for about 3% of the total excess mortality rate. The atmospheric chemistry model was initially run for 20 y (excluding 5-y spin-up) with prescribed ocean temperatures to analyze health impacts and climate forcings, following IPCC recommendations (11), including changes in cloud reflectivity through the effects of aerosols on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) (12). Uniquely, we included the increase in CCN activity of aeolian (wind-blown) dust particles is due to interaction with air pollution (chemical “aging”), which generally increases their ability to take up water. SI Appendix, Fig. S1 shows a comparison between modeled and satellite observed aerosol optical depth, SI Appendix, Fig. S2 for rainfall, SI Appendix, Fig. S3 for PM2.5 and dust aerosol optical depth, and SI Appendix, Figs. S4 and S5 present the calculated aerosol radiative forcing of climate, which match the IPCC ensemble model estimates (11). Subsequently, the same model was rerun for 30-y periods (excluding 5-y spin-up) with an interactive ocean to compute equilibrium climate responses. We accounted for air pollution and greenhouse gases in idealized scenario calculations to characterize the public health and climate impacts of a hypothetical phaseout from fossil-fuel-related and other anthropogenic emissions, a distinction that could be essential for policy-making.
Results
Table 1 presents the excess mortality rate attributed to air pollution and the associated years of life lost (YLL), and the 15 countries that lead the ranking. SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2 itemize the excess mortality and YLL for different countries and disease categories, including uncertainty ranges, and SI Appendix, Fig. S6 shows a global map of the excess mortality. We find that the global total excess mortality rate is 8.79 million per year, with a 95% confidence interval of 7.11–10.41 million per year. The associated number of YLL is 233(95%CI 185–278) million per year. Consequently, the mean life expectancy decrease per affected individual is about 26.5 y (233/8.79), while the global mean loss of life expectancy is 2.9 (95%CI 2.3–3.5) y. Main causes of death are ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, lung cancer, other noncommunicable diseases, and lower respiratory tract infections. Fig. 1 and Table 1 present the avoidable deaths by removing the fossil-fuel-related emissions in our model, i.e., from traffic, power generation, and industry. Further, we show the impact of removing all anthropogenic sources, which also includes agriculture, residential energy use, and nonfossil industrial emissions. We assumed that desert dust emissions cannot be controlled (even though a fraction of about 25% may be human-induced; see ref. 13) and that 90% of biomass burning emissions can be avoided (14).

Avoidable deaths and unavoidable net warming consider sources of air pollution and greenhouse gases. SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2 present results for the different disease categories and all countries, plus 95% confidence intervals.
Fig. 1.

Avoidable excess mortality rate from air pollution. Units: deaths per 1,000 km2/y. (A) Excess deaths that may be avoided by the phasing out of fossil fuels, and (B) by all anthropogenic emissions. (C) Relative contribution to excess deaths from fossil fuel use compared with all anthropogenic emissions. The dark-blue regions would profit more from removing fossil-fuel-related emissions, while the light-blue ones profit more from removing other pollution sources.
By removing the fossil-fuel-related emissions in our model, we find that 3.61(95%CI 2.96–4.21) × 106/y of the attributable deaths can be avoided (Table 1). The avoidable mortality from all anthropogenic pollution is 5.55(95%CI 4.52–6.52) × 106/y. Considering that this is a factor of 3 higher than the mortality rate from other avoidable environmental risks such as unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene (3), reducing air pollution is clearly an effective and urgent health intervention. The fact that a substantial mortality fraction is nevertheless difficult to prevent is largely related to natural sources, including desert dust to which a growing number of people are exposed. Furthermore, the hazard ratio functions are nonlinear, so that especially at relatively low PM2.5 concentrations, below about 10–20 µg/m3 (annual average), large health benefits can be achieved. We find that in some regions, for example in Africa where aeolian dust and biomass burning aerosols are abundant, it will be difficult to reduce PM2.5 to very low levels, e.g., to the WHO air-quality guideline concentration of 10 µg/m3 or the minimum risk exposure level of 2.4–5.9 µg/m3 (10). Fig. 1 and Table 1 demonstrate how public health outcomes from emission controls can differ greatly among countries worldwide. For example, the phaseout of fossil energy emissions has relatively larger health gains in North America than in South Asia and Africa. The latter regions can benefit greatly from controlling residential energy use and biomass burning, and in Europe and East Asia agricultural emissions are important. On the other hand, the peoples of Egypt and Sudan are strongly impacted by desert dust emissions, which are difficult to control.
Reducing air pollution also has major implications for climate change, water, and food security, the latter in part through negative impacts of O3 on crop yields (15). By decreasing aerosol concentrations, tropical precipitation tends to increase, because the particles shield the oceans from solar radiation, which inhibits evaporation and decelerates the hydrologic cycle (16–18). Aerosol radiative forcing at the Earth’s surface is relatively strong as the particles both scatter and absorb sunlight, the latter, e.g., by black carbon (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). On a regional scale the surface cooling of aerosols can strongly exceed the greenhouse gas warming. By removing aerosol pollution, we find substantial regional invigoration of the hydrologic cycle, with 10–70% increases in precipitation over the densely populated Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP), 10–30% over northern China including the capital Beijing, 10–40% over West Africa and the Sahel, and 10–40% over Central America (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Restoring the hydrologic cycle and the monsoonal flow in these regions could promote the wet deposition of aerosols, including the natural ones, which may create a positive feedback by removing the particles. Observations corroborate that these four regions experienced major decreases in rainfall, such as the devastating Sahelian drought that began in the late 1960s and continued until about 2010, the decrease in monsoon rainfall over the IGP, and dryness in northern China and Mexico. This substantiates previous studies that have linked aerosol pollution to drying conditions (16–18). Our results indicate that aerosols from fossil fuel use explain roughly half of these effects globally, while other anthropogenic sources, including biomass burning, contribute the other half. The aerosol weakening of the hydrologic cycle could be rapidly reversed after the phaseout of pollution emissions.
Fig. 2.

Fractional precipitation changes at the surface. Effects from the removal of fossil-fuel-related and all anthropogenic pollution emissions in Asia, Africa, and Central America. Crosses denote areas where precipitation changes are not significant at the 95% confidence level.
Finally, our model simulations show that fossil-fuel-related aerosols have masked about 0.51(±0.03) °C of the global warming from increasing greenhouse gases (Fig. 3). The largest temperature impacts are found over North America and Northeast Asia, being up to 2 °C. By removing all anthropogenic emissions, a mean global temperature increase of 0.73(±0.03) °C could even warm some regions up to 3 °C. Since the temperature increase from past CO2 emissions is irreversible on human timescales, the aerosol warming will be unleashed during the phaseout (11, 19–22). Some near-term mitigation can be achieved from the simultaneous reduction of short-lived greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4), O3, and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) (15, 23–25). Fossil-fuel-related CH4 emissions constitute nearly 20% of the total source, and removing all anthropogenic CH4 (nearly 60% of the source), in addition to anthropogenic O3, would limit the near-term warming to 0.36(±0.06) °C. While the current climate forcing of HFCs is still small, it will be critical to prevent increases in the future, as they are potent greenhouse gases (26). Table 1 presents the unavoidable net warming from emission control measures that simultaneously affect aerosols and greenhouse gases, which have many sources in common. SI Appendix, Table S1 lists these results for all countries, including the uncertainty intervals.

Discussion
While we have consistently addressed air pollution and greenhouse gas effects on public health, climate, and the hydrologic cycle in context, and distinguished fossil-fuel-related emissions from other pollution sources, some aspects have been addressed by other groups. Next, we discuss our results in view of recent studies that complement and corroborate the robustness of our calculations.
Health Risks.
Possible future impacts of air pollution on mortality have been estimated previously by using the output from chemistry–climate and chemical transport models that applied Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCPs) (27). Apart from the fact that the new GEMM was not available at the time, it differed from our approach by estimating increased and avoided mortality from different RCPs, assuming that economic development drives air pollution control. Here we estimate the attributable effects of both fossil fuel and all anthropogenic air pollution plus greenhouse gases by removing emissions in the model, rather than applying time-dependent scenarios that rely on assumptions about socioeconomic futures. While this may seem a daring assumption, these source categories will need to be phased out to reach the 2 °C target of the Paris Agreement (7). We realize, however, that especially agricultural emissions cannot be fully avoided in a world with growing food demand, although a large fraction (e.g., of ammonia and methane sources) could be effectively controlled. A limitation of our approach is that it refers to emission and demographic data for 2015, while population growth is expected up to about 9 billion by the middle of the century, especially in developing countries where air pollution levels can be very high. Therefore, we performed sensitivity simulations that account for the projected population in 2050, indicating that the total excess mortality may be about 10% higher globally. Most of the increase is due to population growth in South and West Asia, and especially in Africa, while in East Asia the population is expected to decline. In Europe and the Americas (notably South America) projected population changes are comparatively small. Interestingly, the avoidable excess mortality in 2015 and 2050 are practically the same (within 1–2%). Furthermore, we did not take into account that the introduction of clean household energy in low-income countries could substantially reduce excess deaths from household air pollution, estimated at about 2.9–4.3 million per year (3). The phaseout of anthropogenic emissions is expected to be paralleled by a reduction of household air pollution from the introduction of clean “zero carbon” domestic energy sources.
Climate Forcing.
SI Appendix, Fig. S4 presents model results of the direct and total aerosol radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). The direct aerosol forcing is ?0.46 ± 0.009 W/m2, which closely agrees with the best estimate of ?0.45 W/m2 of the IPCC (11). Our total direct plus indirect radiative forcing is ?0.9 W/m2, which also agrees with IPCC (11). However, by also accounting for the chemical aging of aeolian dust by air pollution we obtain a ?0.3-W/m2 larger effect, about ?1.2 ± 0.06 W/m2 (28, 29). The dust aging has multiple consequences, such as increased solar radiation scattering from hygroscopic particle growth and decreased lifetime from more efficient rainout, while the climate effect is dominated by the enhanced CCN activity. Since dust particles are globally abundant and relatively large in size, their increased hygroscopicity effectively enhances cloud droplet formation (29). To account for these effects, it is needed to simulate the particle chemistry and thermodynamics of crustal ions, dependent on the composition of aeolian dust from different deserts, which was not included in the IPCC climate models. SI Appendix, Figs. S3 and S4 show the global, multiannual mean geographic distribution of the aerosol direct and total radiative forcing, both at the TOA and the bottom of the atmosphere (BOA), making the distinction between fossil fuel generated and all anthropogenic aerosols. The differences between the TOA and BOA forcings represent heating of the atmosphere through the absorption of sunlight, mostly by black carbon. We find that the negative (cooling) BOA forcings from aerosols are generally largest over South and East Asia, partly in excess of ?20 W/m2 (annual average), which can regionally dwarf the positive (warming) radiative forcing from greenhouse gases. The strong surface cooling downwind over the ocean can significantly reduce evaporation and precipitation on a regional scale (16).
Climate Response.
We performed equilibrium climate response computations, following the example of Shindell et al. (15), with the difference that they computed atmospheric composition changes offline with different models, whereas we calculate the processes online with a coupled atmosphere–ocean model. The equilibrium assumption is justified for short-lived climate forcers since most of the climate response that follows phaseout of fossil fuels and other pollution sources happens within a few decades. Although the equilibrium assumption does not apply to CO2, this is not relevant here because the phaseout of CO2 emissions does not translate in a near-term temperature decrease (11, 19–22). In the period during which CO2 concentrations still increase, the warming is tempered by heat transport into the deep oceans. When CO2 emissions are phased out, the atmospheric concentrations can decrease, but with a delay due to the slow uptake of anthropogenic CO2 by the oceans (30). These physical climate and carbon cycle effects are of opposite sign and of similar magnitude. Consequently, even if fossil CO2 emissions stop abruptly, global temperatures remain constant for several centuries, which means that past CO2 emissions commit the planet to persistent warming on the human timescale (for a discussion, see ref. 11). While the timing of air pollution and greenhouse gas emission phaseout is the subject of scenario studies, here we focus on the climate response magnitude. For example, global warming from increasing CO2 scales approximately linearly with cumulative emissions (11). It implies that the phaseout may occur over 5 or 50 y, but the integral climate response over these periods is the same. In fact, the key factor is “societal inertia” from the slow phaseout of polluting infrastructure, often constructed to last for many decades (30, 31).
The warming and precipitation pattern changes that result from removing aerosols in our climate simulations (Fig. 3 and SI Appendix, Fig. S7) are comparable to those presented by Samset et al. (32), who analyzed the ensemble results from four climate models. They reported that the removal of anthropogenic aerosols causes a global mean surface warming of 0.5–1.1° and a precipitation increase of 2.0–4.6%, where we find 0.73 ± 0.03 °C and 3.2 ± 0.2%, respectively. Consistent with our results, they showed how the aerosol-related climate response patterns differ markedly from those of greenhouse gases. However, they studied anthropogenic emissions of SO2 and fossil fuel black and organic carbon, without the distinction between fossil fuel use and other anthropogenic sources, and did not consider pollution impacts on dust. Further, they did not account for the greenhouse gases O3 and CH4, and calculated CO2 and aerosol reductions separately to contrast the cooling and warming patterns. While greenhouse gases act globally, the radiative forcing and consequent net warming from aerosol removal is regional and most pronounced over the continental northern hemisphere (Fig. 3). In agreement with the results of Samset et al., we find that the removal of aerosols creates south–north shifts of precipitation over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and relatively strong rainfall increases over Africa, South and Northeast Asia (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Westervelt et al. (33) studied precipitation changes from the removal of SO2 emissions in the United States. The computed reductions of aerosol sulfate and cloud droplet number concentrations were found to cause increasing precipitation over the United States, and downwind over the Atlantic Ocean, qualitatively consistent with our results. SI Appendix, Figs. S3 and S4 illustrate that the direct radiative effect of aerosols at the BOA typically exceeds that at the TOA by a factor of 2–3, e.g., due to solar radiation absorption within the atmosphere by black carbon, and that the radiative forcing can regionally exceed the global average by a factor of 5–10. This results in strong, although localized influence on surface temperature, evaporation and associated precipitation.
Regional Hydrologic Cycle Changes.
Numerous studies have addressed the causes of observed decreases in precipitation over tropical regions, and analyzed the influence of pollution aerosols on the monsoon circulation over South and East Asia, and to a lesser extent over Africa. An exhaustive review of the South and East Asian studies can be found in Li et al. (34). The basic inference has been that the radiative forcing from increasing greenhouse gases is unlikely to account for the sign and magnitude of negative precipitation trends, associated with a weakening of the monsoon. Dominant factors are trends in sea-surface temperature (SST), particularly the asymmetric warming of the southern tropical oceans relative to the northern oceans. Two principal forcing mechanisms have been proposed. Interdecadal variability of SSTs; and the negative aerosol forcing (from direct and indirect effects) of the ocean surface, which is larger in the northern than the southern hemisphere. Further, the solar dimming from pollution aerosols reduces the land–ocean heating contrast (since pollution levels are highest over land areas), so that winds at the surface weaken and evaporation decreases, hence affecting the dominant drivers of the monsoon. There is compelling evidence that anthropogenic aerosol forcing explains most of the drying tendency in South Asia, also simulated by our model, and supported by observations (35–38). Our results support those of Chen et al. (39), who modeled pollution-induced precipitation reductions over Southeast and Northeast Asia, triggered by aerosol cooling of the midlatitude sea surface. Likewise, in East Asia aerosol cooling over land reduces the thermal contrast with the ocean, and weakens the monsoon circulation (40). Further, it was found that the weakening monsoon contributes to the pollution haze in the Beijing area (41). Negative rainfall trends have been observed over Northeast China, enhanced by the aerosol forcing, which was not captured well by climate models in the past (34, 42), which underscores the need for a comprehensive account of these processes.
For the Sahel, drying during the latter part of the 20th century has been largely attributed to changes in SST patterns, influenced by external greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings as well as internal climate variability (43–45). By comparing climate model simulations with increasing greenhouse gases to those that also account for pollution aerosols it was shown that the latter cause a meridional SST gradient, associated with a reduced West African monsoon flow (46). Hence, the reduction or removal of anthropogenic aerosol forcing can be expected to increase the North Atlantic SST, leading to a moistening of the Sahel (47, 48). In addition, warming of the Mediterranean, through a decrease in solar dimming from European pollution, contributes to evaporation and moisture transport into the eastern Sahel (49, 50). Our results demonstrate that the asymmetric aerosol radiative forcing creates interhemispheric heating gradients and meridional rainfall shifts over all tropical oceans, including the Pacific (Fig. 2), which could be restored by removing the particulate pollutants. While Central America has been affected by droughts throughout its history, including El Niño influence on summer precipitation, our model simulations suggest that recent dryness, e.g., in Mexico, has been aggravated by air pollution. More work will be needed to substantiate these findings. Generally, it is a major challenge to attribute the contributions of greenhouse gas and aerosol forcings to decadal precipitation trends, and distinguish them from natural variability of the atmosphere–ocean system.
Cocontrolling Air Pollution and Greenhouse Gases.
Our model results show that the phaseout of air pollution emissions leads to substantial precipitation increases in these four regions. Recovery from aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns could be relevant for countries with rapidly growing populations, e.g., in the Sahel, South Asia, and West Africa, which depend on monsoon rainfall for water availability and food production. While the surface temperature and hydrologic cycle respond rapidly to the radiative forcings of short-lived climate pollutants such as aerosols, the response to CO2 emissions is irreversible for centuries (11, 19–22, 30). On the other hand, the simultaneous reduction of short-lived greenhouse gases, such as O3, counteracts the warming from removing aerosols on short timescales. We find that the fossil-fuel-related and the total anthropogenic O3 cooling could compensate about 0.12 and 0.19 °C of the aerosol warming, respectively (i.e., counteracting the 0.51 and 0.73 °C warming from fossil and total anthropogenic aerosols). The reduction of fossil methane, on the other hand, has limited impact, as it accounts for less than 20% of the total source, while an additional 40% of the emissions are related to other anthropogenic activities such as agriculture (rice paddies, domesticated animals), landfills, biomass burning, and biofuel use. Phasing out fossil as well as nonfossil CH4 emissions additionally moderates the warming from removing aerosols by about 0.21 °C.
The importance of reducing methane emissions to mitigate climate change, in part through the impact on O3, and together with black carbon, was emphasized by Shindell et al. (15), who calculated the cobenefits for human health and food security. They developed CH4 and black carbon scenarios to optimally decrease the rate of climate warming (up to about 0.5 °C), and considered improved air quality and food security as cobenefits. Here we stress that a complete phaseout of fossil fuels, and accompanying reductions of other anthropogenic emissions, will be needed to reverse the major impacts on public health, regional climate, water supply, and food production. The prospect of preventing millions of excess deaths attributable to air pollution, and restoring perturbations of the hydrologic cycle that have contributed to regional drying, with the cobenefit of limiting climate warming to below 2 °C, is compelling and underscores the urgency of acting on global environmental change.
Conclusion
The mutual goals of clean air and a stable climate under the WHO guidelines and the Paris Agreement require a rapid phaseout of fossil fuels. Other pollution sources such as agriculture, biomass burning, and residential energy use should be controlled as well, to achieve a mortality reduction up to 5.55 million excess deaths annually (with additional mortality reduction from reduced household air pollution), limit the warming from aerosol removal, and restore the monsoon rainfall. Replacing fossil by clean, renewable energy sources could decrease the global attributable mortality by 65%, and up to 84% in the United States. If air pollution would be controlled by traditional end-of-pipe techniques alone to abate fine particulates, but leaving greenhouse gas emissions unchanged, global warming could be enhanced by 0.51(±0.03) °C, while removal of all anthropogenic aerosols can unleash 0.73(±0.03) °C (and >2 °C in the United States). However, if air pollution and greenhouse gases are removed concurrently by replacing the common sources, a reduced residual, but unavoidable near-term global warming of 0.36(±0.06) °C will be liberated. Since a temperature increase of 1.0(±0.2 likely range) °C has been realized already, and considering the observed warming rate of 0.2(±0.1) °C per decade (high confidence) (51), our results suggest that it is very unlikely that the 1.5 °C target is achieved this century without massive CO2 extraction from the air. However, with a phaseout by midcentury the 2 °C goal may still be within reach."
"Fossil fuels can be defined as the material containing hydrocarbons that are generated from the remains of the dead and decay of plants and animals that are buried underground for many years, which are extracted and burned by humans to release energy for various uses. The three main fossil fuels are natural gas, coal, and petroleum. These are extracted by humans through mining and drilling. Fossil fuels are burnt to generate energy that can be used for direct heating in cooking purposes, for power engines like motor engines or internal combustion engines or for electricity generation. 


Other chemical derivatives can be derived from fossil fuels when they are refined in the chemical industries by various processes. The refined fossil fuels that are commonly used are kerosene, gasoline, and propane and some of the common chemically derived products include plastics and agricultural products such as fertilisers and pesticides. In spite of having a wide range of uses, it is marked to be harmful to the environment as they cause a direct effect on the communities and the climate in every step of their use starting from the extraction and transportation to consumption of the fuels.  


Types of Fossil Fuels
Let us understand how fossil fuels are formed. Fossil fuel is formed when any of a class of hydrocarbon-containing materials of biological origin occurring within the Earth’s crust that can be used as a source of energy.

There are Three Primary Varieties of Fossil Fuels:

Petroleum,

Natural gas, and

Coal.

Let us understand the varieties of fossil fuels.

Petroleum: 

Petroleum, also called oil, is the most often used and discussed form of fossil fuel around the globe today. Today, we think of oil as the fuel that we pump into our cars at pump stations, but refined gasoline is not what comes out of the ground at oil wells.

On the contrary, crude oil is a form of petroleum that happens naturally. Petroleum consists of carbon and hydrogen that has gone through an organic phase in single-cell plants or being animals, like blue-green algae or animals.

The preserved remains of such organisms become petroleum through a process called Diagenesis. Petroleum is classified by its predominant hydrocarbon. There are 5 grades of crude oil based on specific gravity ranging from heavy to light, the latter being the most desirable.  

Natural Gas: 

Natural Gas is made up of methane and is incredibly lightweight. While petroleum is generated solely inside the oil window. Natural gas migrates up from deep below Earth’s surface and accumulates in traps, along with petroleum. They have three main properties: colour, odour, and flammability. Methane is colourless, odourless, and highly flammable.

Coal:	

Here natural gas is a gas, petroleum is a liquid, and coal is, of course, a solid. Coal looks like chunks of midnight black rock, which are harvested from the Earth by workers in mining operations. During surface or underground mining, coal can be recovered. For surface mining, the process is straightforward. Coal is composed of 5 diverse elements: oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulphur, with the distributions of those 5 elements varying depending on the piece of coal. In any case, coal today is used for everything from producing steel and cement to keeping the lights at homes and Industries. 

Hydrocarbon – Any category of organic chemical compounds composed solely of carbon (C) and hydrogen gas (H).

Methane: A chemical compound with the chemical formula CH4.


The Effects of Burning Fossil Fuel
Burning fossil fuels can affect the environment, air quality, climatic conditions, and human health. Every recent study by scientists states that the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas for energy is the main contributor to the rapidly rising level of carbon dioxide that is driving climate change. As the burning of fossil fuels increases, the climatic condition will change and increase the temperature. Fossil fuel extraction, processing, and burning can have negative health effects on the communities. 

 

Global Warming Pollution
Fossil fuel and global warming are closely associated with each other. The presence of high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere results in an increase in the amount of heat and temperature on the surface of the Earth. This is because carbon dioxide traps heat obtained from sunlight and it does not dissipate out of the atmosphere, this process is known as the greenhouse effect. Since fossil fuels are hydrocarbons (made from hydrogen and carbon), burning fossil fuels releases an enormous amount of carbon dioxide into the air. When there's a major rise in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air, the amount of heat captured by the carbon dioxide gas also increases. This, in turn, results in an overall rise in the surface temperature of the Earth, which is additionally referred to as global warming.


Higher Rise in the Sea Level 
The rise in the sea level can adversely affect the climate of the Earth. We will witness a drastic change in the weather conditions in various parts of the world. The glaciers of the Earth will melt at a much faster rate. As a result of this, the areas which are located near the water bodies like the coastal regions and the banks of the river are likely to get submerged underwater.


Lots of islands, deltas, and thickly inhabited cities will get enclosed by water. Droughts and floods can occur more frequently in several inland areas that have extreme weather. The cities that are situated near the sea would also suffer the consequences.


Other Forms of Air Pollution
We also cause air pollution indirectly, like when we buy goods and services that make use of energy in their manufacture and delivery. Most of this air pollution we tend to cause results from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, natural gas, and gasoline to produce electricity and power for our vehicles. Fossil fuels emit more than simply carbon dioxide when burned. Due to the burning of fossil fuels, many harmful pollutants are formed such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter, lead, mercury, and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Coal-fired power plants singlehandedly generate 42 per cent of dangerous mercury emissions and the vast majority of the particulate matter in our air. In the meantime, fossil fuel-powered trucks, cars, and boats are the main suppliers of toxic carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen oxide, which produces smog (and metabolism illnesses) on hot days. Fuels such as coal, and petroleum release unburnt particles into the environment. The particles result in air pollution and cause respiratory diseases such as respiratory illness, lung damage, ozone (smog) effect, reduces the ability of blood to bring oxygen to the blood cells and tissues, liver and kidney, etc. 


Toxic Gases Causing Acid Rain
The burning of fossil fuels gives out harmful compounds like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. These substances will rise terribly high into the atmosphere, wherever they combine and react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals to form a lot of acidic pollutants, called air pollution. Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides dissolve very easily with water and are carried very far by the wind. As a result, both the compounds can travel long distances where they become part of the rain, sleet, snow, and fog that we experience on certain days. 


Human activities are the main reason for acid rain. Over the past few decades, we humans have released so many different chemicals into the air that they have changed the mix of gases in the atmosphere. Huge power plants release the majority of sulphur dioxide and much of the nitrogen oxides when they burn fossil fuels, such as coal, to produce electricity. In addition to this, the gases from cars, trucks, and buses release nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide into the air. These pollutants cause acid rain by the wind. 


Oil Spills
Crude oil or petroleum is often transported from one place to another by tankers and ships. Any leakage in these tankers causes oil spills. This issue can lead to water pollution and poses a problem for marine life. Thus, we can see that the issues of fossil fuels, global warming, and climate change are all interwoven with each other. We all have to play a vital role in controlling their harmful effects. If we take some small measures from our side, then we can save our mother Earth from any major disaster. We should reduce energy consumption in our homes when not in use and use our vehicles only for travelling short distances. We also have to stop cutting trees and plant more saplings regularly. This is because plants use up the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and thus check its level from rising and protecting the environment. Our activities have put the Earth at risk, and it's now our responsibility to reverse the trend.


Ocean Acidification
When we burn crude oil, coal, and gas, we change the ocean’s basic chemistry, making it more acidic. Our seas absorb as much as a quarter of all carbon emitted. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution and our fossil fuel-burning ways, the ocean has become 30 per cent more acidic. As the acidity in our waters increases, the amount of calcium carbonate which is a substance used by oysters, lobsters, and countless other marine organisms to form shells will go down. The growth rate of the species when reduced weakens the shells and imperils entire food chains. 


When we start analysing the effects caused by burning fossil fuels, we can conclude that all the problems are interlinked. We have to reduce the burning of fuels and save our environment.


Facts about Fossil Fuels
Modern society is majorly built up upon the burning of fossil fuels. These fuels are generated deep within the Earth crust due to high pressure and temperature for over a million years and finally result in the formation of “non-renewable” energy. Out of all the energies, we consume on a daily basis, 80% of it comes from fossil fuels. Thus, below there are a few facts that are mentioned about fossil fuels:

All fossil fuels are the result of the decomposition of dead and decaying matter like plants and animals for millions of years underwater under high temperature and pressure.

Though fossil fuels are used in the generation of energy to produce electricity and many more energy forms, it is also used to develop various grades of plastics.

Fossil fuels may run out really fast as the study suggests that we have limited oil resources that will last for another 100 years and the non-renewable source of energy that will last for another 1000 years. 

One of the most undiscovered fossil fuels is oil shales which are a game-changer in today’s scenario. It has been studied that it is thousand times greater and more efficient than crude oil to develop energy and is found around the world. 

Fossil fuels are more cost-efficient and thus most of the energy resources are derived from fossil fuels."
"Gone are the days when you could fill up your car gas tank with US$20. Yet, despite the steady increases, gas prices are still artificially low, keeping transportation and national production costs relatively contained and internationally competitive. Unfortunately, this situation is deeply unsustainable, particularly if we are to seriously curb our CO2 emissions, slow our impact on climate change and reduce air pollution.

Every year, governments spend between US$160 and US$400 billion as fossil fuel subsidies for the production and use of coal, oil and gas. Payments to consumers, companies, tax breaks or other fiscal incentives are some of the ways governments subsidize fossil fuels, moving ever farther away from meeting the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.

“Understanding the size of existing fossil fuel subsidies is an important first step towards achieving reform,” says UN Environment fossil fuel subsidy expert Joy Kim. “You can’t manage what you can’t measure.” In contrast, the total financial support to renewable energy amounts to US$121 billion.

UN Environment is responsible for monitoring the progress of phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and has been working with numerous country partners, international organizations and non-governmental organizations to come up with a robust way to measure such subsidies.

In September of 2018, an agreement was reached by the Inter-Agency Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators (composed of Member States including regional and international agencies as observers) on the first internationally agreed approach to measuring fossil fuel subsidies that UN Environment has developed together with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Global Subsidies Initiative and proposed.

The momentum to reform fossil fuel subsidies has grown in recent years, as countries discover not only the necessities, but also the benefits of subsidy removal. For example, in June 2018, Argentina and Canada committed to peer reviews of their fossil fuel subsidies under the G20 process. China, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico and the USA had done this earlier.

Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Ensure sustainable consumption and production) also includes a target to rationalize inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption. The importance of monitoring fossil fuel subsidies is recognized in the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals with a dedicated indicator to assess country progress.

In the context of the Sustainable Development Goals, UN Environment is responsible for collecting national data on this indicator from 193 UN member countries. Data collection will start in 2020 and continue until 2030, feeding into the Sustainable Development Goal global database maintained by the UN Statistics Division.

“If sufficient guidance and support are provided to countries to facilitate their reporting, this process could improve transparency on fossil fuel subsidies, and provide an impetus for reform by informing decision-making, increasing awareness and building support among stakeholders,” says Kim.

The damage caused by fossil fuel subsidies

The burning of fossil fuels is a significant contributor to air pollution, which kills seven million people a year and is linked to “huge” reductions in intelligence.

By artificially lowering prices, subsidies drive wasteful energy consumption which increases local air pollution and congestion, while crowding out investment in renewables and energy efficiency. They lock us into a high-carbon energy world.

Coal, oil and gas not only produce health-damaging pollutants when they burn: the extraction process also produces significant quantities of carbon dioxide and methane.

The sheer size of the subsidies is a significant drain on national budgets, diverting resources from other areas like health and education.


The International Monetary Fund estimates that removing fossil fuel subsidies and then taxing fossil fuels correctly (based on the cost borne to society through air pollution, carbon emissions and accidents) could lead to a decline in fossil-fuel related carbon emissions by over 20 per cent globally. Removing the subsidies would also reduce premature air pollution-related deaths by over 50 per cent and raise government revenue by US$2.9 trillion (3.6 per cent of global gross domestic product), it says. (IMF, 2015).

Although advocated as a measure to fight poverty, fossil fuel subsidies often do not reach the poorest households and instead tend to benefit wealthier segments of society more.

On 27 November UN Environment launched its Emissions Gap report 2018 [hyperlink to report], which underscores the need for further action by all countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases."
"The negative impacts of fossil fuel use begin with the extraction of the resource. Fossils fuels are often located far from where they are utilized so they need to be transported by pipeline, tankers, rail or trucks. These all present the potential for accidents, leakage, and spills. Additional negative impacts are associated with processing, electricity generation, and disposal of the waste generated.

Coal Mining and Usage
Surface mining of coal disrupts local ecosystems above coal deposits as overburden is removed to access them (figure  16.4.b ). In mountaintop removal, a large volume of overburden is dumped over nearby habitats, causing further destruction (figure  16.4.c ). Mountaintop removal has affected large areas of the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia and Kentucky. Habitat loss from coal mining decreases biodiversity, resulting in a loss of ecosystem services. Both surface and subsurface mining expose rocks that can contain contaminants, such as heavy metals or sulfates, which them leach into streams or other bodies of water. This not only harms aquatic life, but it also disrupts nutrient cycling. One of the largest environmental impacts of subsurface mining may be the methane gas that must be vented out of mines to make the mines a safe place to work. Methane gas is a potent greenhouse gas and contributes to climate change. Finally, the process of mining ultimately compacts soil. This combined with the loss of trees, which slow the flow of run-off and promote infiltration, increases the risk of flooding.

Coal miners face health hazards such as explosions, mine collapse, and exposure to toxic fumes. Black lung disease is a respiratory condition characterized by coughing and shortness of breath that occurs in miners exposed to too much coal dust. Residents near mines also risk exposure to coal dust and underground toxins following explosions. As a result of exposure to toxins, birth defects and other health problems are common in residents near mines.

Coal is considered the “dirtiest” source of energy because its combustion results in the most air pollution. Coal power plants emits a variety of air pollutants including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and heavy metals. Sulfur dioxide and  nitrogen oxide are sources of acid rain (acid deposition), smog, and health issues. Heavy metals cause neurological and developmental problems in humans and other animals. Burning of coal emits particulate matter and higher amounts of carbon dioxide per unit of energy than the use of oil or natural gas. Carbon dioxide is the most frequently emitted greenhouse gas and causes climate change. In 2018, electricity generation was responsible 27% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, and much of this was emitted from coal power plants. The transportation of coal usually relies on fossil fuels, releasing further pollution.

Ash (including fly ash and bottom ash) is a residue created when coal is burned at power plants. In the past, fly ash was released into the air through the smokestack, where it would contribute to particulate matter air pollution. Laws now require that much of the fly ash now must be be captured by pollution control devices, like scrubbers. In the United States, fly ash is generally stored at coal power plants or placed in landfills. Ash from storage or landfills can spill or leach into groundwater, resulting in water pollution.

Conventional Extraction Oil and Natural Gas
Exploring and drilling for oil degrades land and ocean habitats. On land, extensive infrastructure such as road networks, transport pipelines and housing for workers are needed to support a full-scale drilling operation. These can pollute soil and water, fragment habitats, and disturb wildlife. Extraction of oil and natural gas is also hazardous for workers, who have a high incidence of cancer and heart disease.

Human-caused oil spills in rivers and oceans harm ecosystems. From an economic perspective, oil spills disrupt the fishing industry and tourism. Oil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin oil slick which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. This can kill sea birds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms it coats. Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly bulldozed around the spill site before most of the oil escapes, and land animals can avoid the oil more easily.

Oil spills can result from supertanker accidents such as the Exxon Valdez in 1989, which spilled 10 million gallons of oil into the rich ecosystem of coastal Alaska and killed massive numbers of animals. The largest marine oil spill began in April 2010 when a natural gas explosion at an oil well 65 km offshore of Louisiana occurred on Deepwater Horizon Oil Rig. It killed 11 employees and flowed for 3 months in 2010, releasing an estimated 200 million gallons of oil (figure  16.4.d ). Wildlife, ecosystems, and people’s livelihood were adversely affected. A lot of money and huge amounts of energy were expended on immediate clean-up efforts. The long-term impacts are still not known. The National Commission on the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling was set up to study what went wrong. The worst oil spill ever occurred during the Persian Gulf war of 1991, when Iraq deliberately dumped approximately 200 million gallons of oil in offshore Kuwait and set more than 700 oil well fires that released enormous clouds of smoke and acid rain for over nine months.

During an oil spill on water, oil floats to the surface because it is less dense than water, and the lightest hydrocarbons evaporate, decreasing the size of the spill but polluting the air. Then, bacteria begin to decompose the remaining oil, in a process that can take many years. After several months only about 15% of the original volume may remain, but it is in thick asphalt lumps, a form that is particularly harmful to birds, fish, and shellfish. Cleanup operations can include a variety of components, but each has its procs and cons. Skimmer ships that vacuum oil from the water surface, but these are effective only for small spills. Controlled burning works only in early stages before the light, ignitable part evaporates, but this also pollutes the air. Dispersants are detergents that break up oil to accelerate its decomposition, but some dispersants may be toxic to the ecosystem. Bioremediation refers to adding microorganisms that specialize in quickly decomposing oil, but this can disrupt the natural ecosystem.

Unconventional Extraction of Oil and Natural Gas
Fracking causes more environmental damage than conventional extraction. The considerable use of water (figure  16.4.e ) may affect the availability of water for other uses in some regions, and this can affect aquatic habitats. In fact, fracking consumes more water than the use of nuclear energy, coal, or conventional oil and natural gas. If mismanaged, hydraulic fracturing fluid can be released by spills, leaks, or various other exposure pathways that contaminate land and groundwater (figure  16.4.f ). Fracking fluid flowback – the fluid pumped out of the well and separated from oil and gas – not only contains the chemical additives used in the drilling process but also contains heavy metals, radioactive materials (which release radiation), volatile organic compounds, benzene (a carcinogen), toluene, ethylbenze, xylene, and other toxic air pollutants. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can react with the atmosphere to form ground-level ozone, which is associated with respiratory disease. Toulene can cause dizziness, confusion, headaches, and miscarriages. Ethylbenzene is a possible carcinogen that also causes dizziness, eye irritation, and hearing loss. Xylene also causes dizziness and headaches and furthermore can be fatal at high concentrations. In some cases, this contaminated water is sent to water treatment plants that are not equipped to deal with some of these classes of contamination. Finally, injecting wastewater for disposal can even induce earthquakes.

Figure  16.4.e : Fracking influences the water cycle. Water acquisition is the withdrawal of groundwater or surface water to make hydraulic fracturing fluids. Chemical mixing involves combining a base fluid, sand, and additives at the well site to create hydraulic fracturing fluids. During well injection, hydraulic fracturing fluids move through the oil and gas production well and in the targeted rock formation. Produced water handling refers to the onsite collection and handling of water that returns to the surface after hydraulic fracturing and the transportation of that water for disposal or reuse. Finally, the disposal and reuse of wastewater occurs. If this is not done properly, wastewater can pollute surrounding areas. Image and caption (modified) by EPA (public domain).

For example, it can leak through a hole in the casing, move through faulty cement, or move through a fault in the rock that confines the deposit. Image by Government Accountability Office (public domain).
Other unconventional sources of fossil fuels can also harm the environment. Surface mining of tar sands or oil shales requires the removal of all vegetation and leaves pollutants behind, causing habitat loss (figure  16.4.g ).

Transportation, Refineries, and Combustion
Natural gas is released into the atmosphere from coal mines, oil and gas wells, and natural gas storage tanks, pipelines, and processing plants. These leaks are the source of about 25% of total U.S. methane emissions, which translates to three percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. When natural gas is produced but cannot be captured and transported economically, it is “flared,” or burned at well sites, which converts it to carbon dioxide. This is considered to be safer and better than releasing methane into the atmosphere because carbon dioxide is a less potent greenhouse gas than methane. However, when natural gas with high concentrations of the toxic gas hydrogen sulfide is flared, it produces carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and many other compounds (see Air Pollution for more details).

Leaks also happen when we use petrochemicals on land. For example, gasoline sometimes drips onto the ground when people are filling their gas tanks, when motor oil gets thrown away after an oil change, or when fuel escapes from a leaky storage tank. When it rains, the spilled petrochemicals get washed into the gutter and eventually flow to rivers and into the ocean. Another way that oil sometimes gets into water is when fuel is leaked from motorboats and jet skis. When a leak in a storage tank or pipeline occurs, petrochemicals can also get into the ground, and the ground must be cleaned up. To prevent leaks from underground storage tanks, all buried tanks are supposed to be replaced by tanks with a double lining.

Oil refining emits a variety of toxins and is the single largest source of benzene (figure  16.4.g ). As a result, residents living near oil refineries have a high incidence of cancer, asthma, and birth defects. When petrochemicals such as gasoline or diesel are burned, they release a variety of air pollutants, including carbon dioxide (a cause of climate change), sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter, and lead (see Air Pollution for more details). The transport of oil by ship or trunk also requires energy in the form of fossil fuels, generating more pollutants. Compared to oil and coal, burning natural gas releases the fewest pollutants and greenhouse gases.

Solutions
Reclamation can mitigate the habitat damage that results from mining or extracting fossil fuels. It involves restoring the land to an extent after mining or extraction is complete. This can entail returning displaced land and covering with top soil, which protects organisms from heavy metals, radioactive materials, and other underground toxins. Additionally, acids, which often form from the leaching of sulfates from underground rocks, may be neutralized. Vegetation is then planted, and water flow if disrupted is somewhat restored. Of course, the intricate topography, network of streams, and mature vegetation (such as large trees in forest) that may have been present prior to mining cannot be recreated, but reclamation makes it easier for native species to begin recolonizing the area.

Clean coal technologies can limit the air pollution released when burning coal. Some of these technologies remove toxins from coal before burning it while others capture toxins that are released while burning coal. For example, smokestack scrubbers in power plants clean sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter, and mercury from the smoke before it is released. Carbon capture and sequestration involves capturing carbon dioxide released and storing it, but it requires 25-40% more energy, reducing the efficiency of coal (figure  16.4.h ). In this process, smoke from a coal power plant is passed through a solvent to trap carbon dioxide, but other waste gases are still released in the smoke. Carbon dioxide is then separated from the solvent. Some can be used in industry (such as for carbonated beverages or to tertiary recovery of oil), and the rest is sequestered (stored) underground. Note that clean coal technologies can reduce coal's contribution to climate change and reduce the amount of toxins that are released, but it does not fully prevent coal-generated air pollution"
"Powerplants require large volumes of clean freshwater for cooling plant equipment. In the Susquehanna Valley, PA, power generation uses 150 million gallons of water per day. Projected peak water use for shale gas drilling in this area is only 8.5 million gallons of water per day.4

Probability of failure
In the 1980's, the American Petroleum Institute investigated the probability of injected fluids impacting underground sources of drinking water (USDW). Assuming that well casing construction is adequate, the probability of failure was estimated to be between 2 x 10-5 and 2 x 10-8. Due to new advances in well construction technology and taking into account injection conditions, the probability that a well impacts a USDW is estimated to be even less than 2 x 10-8. Other possible avenues for contamination of USDWs include failure of the lined fracking liquids containment ponds. The probability of failure is expected to be higher, but not known.

Other Environmental Concerns
In general, it is more environmentally friendly to extract and burn natural gas than coal. While other fossil fuels are sometimes more damaging and polluting, natural gas production through hydraulic fracturing comes with many additional negative environmental consequences.

Environmental Impacts of Coal

Water Pollution
Coal extraction and burning contribute substantially to water pollution. Clean Air Act permitting rules require coal fired power plants to remove hazardous chemicals from the flue gas. These chemicals are removed using scrubbers, which take the flue gas and remove pollutants into water. Power plant operators are treat this water and are given a discharge permit through the Clean Water Act to discharge into a local waterway. Common contaminants of concern in power plant waste water include arsenic, aluminum, boron, chromium, manganese, nickel, and lead. A New York Times analysis of EPA records found that many harmful pollutants that are found in power plant waste water effluent discharges are not regulated or are regulated only in certain isolated cases.In addition to the spotty regulation of pollutants in the effluent, enforcement of the terms of the discharge permit has been shown to be lax. For instance, the Times investigation found many instances of arsenic entering waterways at concentrations exceeding 18 times the federal drinking water standard.6

Acid Rain
Unlike natural gas, emissions from coal and oil can cause acid rain, which is formed when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides react with hydroxyl radicals in the environment.

Acid Mine Drainage
Another impact of coal mining and extraction on regional water quality is the runoff--called Acid Mine Drainage (AMD)--from active and retired coal mines, and is the most common non-point source pollutant in the Mid Atlantic region. AMD is formed when pyrite reacts with air and water to form sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. This can cause red, yellow, or orange colored sediment in streambeds and dissolve other heavy metals that then are introduced into surface water and groundwater supplies. Over 4,000 miles of streams in the Mid Atlantic region have been impacted by AMD. Additionally, AMD has killed fish and other aquatic wildlife and impacted drinking water supplies.7

Mountaintop Removal

There has been a recent increase in mountaintop coal mining in the United States. This technique involves clearing forests and topsoil from mountains and then using explosives to gain access to coal buried underneath. Mountaintop removal destroys tracts of deciduous forest and leads to increased runoff and habitat destruction. When valleys are filled with the debris produced by mountaintop removal, headwaters can be buried, aquatic ecosystems are damaged, and downstream water becomes heavily polluted. This water pollution is a threat to organisms, ecosystem functioning, and human health.8"

Abstract
The Paris climate goals and the Glasgow Climate Pact require anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to decline to net zero by mid-century. This will require overcoming carbon lock-in throughout the energy system. Previous studies have focused on 'committed emissions' from capital investments in energy-consuming infrastructure, or potential (committed and uncommitted) emissions from fossil fuel reserves. Here we make the first bottom-up assessment of committed CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-producing infrastructure, defined as existing and under-construction oil and gas fields and coal mines. We use a commercial model of the world's 25?000 oil and gas fields and build a new dataset on coal mines in the nine largest coal-producing countries. Our central estimate of committed emissions is 936 Gt CO2, comprising 47% from coal, 35% from oil and 18% from gas. We find that staying within a 1.5 °C carbon budget (50% probability) implies leaving almost 40% of 'developed reserves' of fossil fuels unextracted. The finding that developed reserves substantially exceed the 1.5 °C carbon budget is robust to a Monte Carlo analysis of reserves data limitations, carbon budget uncertainties and oil prices. This study contributes to growing scholarship on the relevance of fossil fuel supply to climate mitigation. Going beyond recent warnings by the International Energy Agency, our results suggest that staying below 1.5 °C may require governments and companies not only to cease licensing and development of new fields and mines, but also to prematurely decommission a significant portion of those already developed.

1. Introduction
Various sources of inertia, or carbon lock-in, in energy systems hinder a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels (Unruh 2000, Seto et al 2016). Long-lived capital stocks, such as power plants, factories, buildings and vehicles, will continue to emit CO2 during their expected economic lifetime unless they are retrofitted or decommissioned prematurely (Fisch-Romito et al 2021). Previous studies have calculated the cumulative 'committed emissions' (Davis et al 2010, Davis and Socolow 2014) of capital stocks of energy-consuming infrastructure (Pfeiffer et al 2018, Smith et al 2019, IEA 2020a), with Tong et al (2019) finding that they exceed the remaining 1.5 °C carbon budget.

Committed emissions accounting (Matthews 2014) can also be applied to the capital stock in fossil fuel extraction, but this has not previously been done. Governments and companies are developing new extraction facilities without understanding how much CO2 is committed by those already built and the related implications for the Paris Agreement goals: to pursue efforts to limit the increase in average global temperature to 1.5 °C and to hold it well below 2 °C, compared to pre-industrial levels (UNFCCC 2015).

Here we conduct the first assessment of committed emissions from the portion of fossil fuel reserves within actively producing or under-construction oil and gas fields and coal mines, which we call 'developed reserves'. Reserves are the quantity of fossil fuel deposits that have been discovered (geologically assessed) and that can be commercially extracted under anticipated economic conditions (figure 1). While several previous studies have assessed total reserves in relation to carbon budgets (Meinshausen et al 2009, McGlade and Ekins 2015, Welsby et al 2021), no study has yet focused on the subset of reserves that is already developed and, therefore, 'locked-in' by past development decisions (unless those decisions are reversed).

Developed reserves are particularly relevant to climate policy because they reflect the cumulative quantity of oil, gas and coal that companies have already discovered and for which a financial and regulatory commitment to extraction has been made. If cumulative potential CO2 emissions from developed reserves exceed the remaining carbon budgets to limit warming to 1.5 °C or well below 2 °C, this would imply that governments licensing and companies exploring for and developing new fossil fuel reserves is inconsistent with the Paris goals. Furthermore, some existing licences and production, or unabated use, would need to be halted to safely achieve the goals, causing stranded assets. The International Energy Agency (IEA) (IEA 2021) recently elevated the issue of fossil fuel supply in policy debates by finding that new oil and gas fields and coal mines are not needed under its 1.5 °C-aligned 'net zero by 2050' scenario. We interrogate a complementary question: To what extent do existing oil and gas fields and coal mines hold more reserves than we need or can burn under Paris temperature limits?"
"Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The intensification of modern conventional agriculture has been effective at increasing crop yields, yet it has come at great cost to the environment and human health from fossil energy consumption and generation of emissions that contribute to climate change and reduced air quality. In 2014, United States agriculture comprised 1.7% of US primary energy consumption and in 2017, comprised 8.4% of total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, (1,2) driven by carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from soil carbon loss and fossil fuel use, nitrous oxide (N2O) from nitrogenous fertilizer use, and methane (CH4) from ruminant livestock production. (3) Increased concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere cost society via harm to human health, property damage due to floods, and losses in agricultural productivity. (4)
Agriculture is also a major contributor to atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) via the production and application of farming inputs and field operations. (5) PM2.5, which adversely affects air quality and human health, is either emitted directly as a product of combustion or as dust (primary PM2.5), or forms in the atmosphere (secondary PM2.5) from reactions among ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOC). (6,7) Due to its small size, PM2.5 can enter the lungs and bloodstream, leading to health effects that include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute lower respiratory illness, ischemic heart disease, and lung cancer. (8) Chronic exposure to PM2.5 generates societal costs via increased risk of premature death. (8,9) In the US, emissions of agricultural NH3 are the dominant driver of PM2.5-emissions related damages, which derive largely from fertilizer application and storage and application of manure. Emissions of PM2.5 also result from diesel fuel production, herbicide production, dust from field operations, and fossil fuel combustion by farm machinery. (5,7,8,10,11) Recent research has shown, for example, that PM2.5 from maize production in the US is responsible for 4300 premature deaths annually. (5)
Overall, increasing energy and resource efficiency while reducing environmental impacts is an important goal for improving the sustainability of agricultural systems. Because agricultural systems are vulnerable to energy price fluctuations, reducing reliance on fossil energy can reduce farm financial volatility and increase profitability, while decreasing fossil energy-related environmental damages. Additional strategies to mitigate GHG emissions from cropping systems include improving fertilizer and manure management, maintaining below- and above-ground soil carbon, and reducing reliance on synthetic inputs. (12) Methods for reducing PM2.5-related emissions and resulting human health impacts include substitution of high NH3-emitting fertilizers with lower ones, using precision agricultural techniques, and selecting crops requiring less nitrogen fertilizer. (5,10,13)
Strategies for simultaneously reducing multiple environmental impacts are especially of interest. Among these is the diversification of conventional corn-soybean cropping systems, which has been shown to deliver several agronomic and environmental benefits, including increased per-hectare corn and soybean productivity, greater resilience to weed and pest infestations, and reduced dependence on synthetic herbicides. (14?17) Diversified cropping systems can also have reduced rates of soil erosion and nutrient discharge to the environment, (15) lower freshwater toxicity loads (14) and enhanced soil functioning. (18?21) The fossil energy use, climate change, and air quality implications of such strategies have not been widely explored.
This study examines the cradle to farm-gate fossil energy consumption, and climate change and air quality damages of three cropping systems differing in levels of crop diversity at the farm-scale. We also evaluated the effects of two contrasting herbicide regimes within each rotation system while focusing on the whole system inputs and whole system outputs. Our analyses were based on crop-specific yield, inputs, fuel consumption, and management data collected from 2008 to 2016 from a field experiment conducted in Boone County, Iowa, USA, in the central Corn Belt, where conventional corn-soybean rotations comprised 70% of planted acres in 2016. (22) We included an accounting of fossil energy consumption and emissions of GHGs, primary PM2.5, and secondary PM2.5 precursors associated with fuel, fertilizer, and herbicide production with on-farm fuel combustion, fertilizer application, and field operations.
We used a life cycle assessment approach to estimate the effects of increasing crop rotation diversity and reducing herbicide use on fossil fuel consumption, and damages from GHG and PM2.5-related emissions. We hypothesized that the diversified crop rotation systems would have lower fossil energy use and GHG and PM2.5 damages than the conventional corn-soybean rotation system, and that a lower herbicide input regime would have lower life cycle impacts than a conventional herbicide regime. We also hypothesized that diversification of cropping systems could allow lower levels of inputs without compromising crop productivity, weed suppression, and profitability."
"Fossil fuel and climate change
Several studies have shown that burning fossil fuels is the biggest source of CO2 emissions and thus the major driving force of climate change1–3. Consequently, scholars critique that current mitigation tools do not address this issue in an adequat way. Emission trading and programms like Reducing Emissions of Degradation and Deforestation (REDD) for example, are seen to not tackle or question the essece  of the fossil fuel economy4. Rather than questioning it carbon trade can be seen as legitimating and stabilizing our fossil fuel based economies4. The mitigation tool provided by the original idea of the Yasuni ITT initiative is different. By leaving fossil fuels under the ground at biodiversity hotspots, which consequently cannot be burnt, this represents an important step towards a more resilient condition for humanity. 

According to a study by the International Energy Agency, one third of all fossil fuels must be left un-extracted if we do not want the temperature to increase more than two degrees by the end of this century5. An analysis of the Gratham Research Institute and Carbon Tracker even states that ""a precautionary approach means only 20% of total fossil fuel reserves can be burnt to 2050""6. With a stress test of the carbon budget, the institutes confirm that the majority of the remaining fossil fuels are ""unburnable""6.  They cannot be burned if we want to maintain a safe human space on our planet7. 

Fossil fuels and their multiple climate change impacts

The LSE research institute for Climate Change and the Environment and Carbon Tracker argue that it is irrational to further invest in the exploration of new reserves as  is the usual practice of fossil fuel companies6. If we cannot burn fossil fuels without destroying our safe human space on our planet it seems logical to avoid extracting them in the first place.

Fossil fuel extraction and usage have multiple social and climate change impacts which lead to the loss of biodiversity and livelihoods. Extraction very often goes hand in hand with deforestation and often results in pollution. Together with the change of the environment around places of extraction it leads to a great loss of biodiversity and the deterioration of the living space of local and indigenous people. Deforestation fosters climate change which again has a negative impact on biodiversity. Research from Harvard University estimates that 25% of species on land will be extirpated by 2050 due to climate change8. Depending on the type of fossil fuel and the method of extraction, different impacts such as decreasing water access for local populations can be observed.

Climate justice and Carbon majors

In the context of fossil fuel extraction the consideration of climate justice is of special relevance. The impact of its extraction is local and mostly located in the South. Most of it is thus burned in the global North. As mentioned above the burning of fossil fuels has an extreme impact on climate change which again is over proportionally affecting those benefitting the least of it. A demand coming from the South to keep fossil fuels under the ground in connection with compensation can strongly be connected to climate justice (See more Martinez-Alier 20079).

A more recent study moreover showed that ""63 percent of the carbon dioxide and methane emitted between 1751 and 2010 [can be attributed] to just 90 entities. Fifty are investor-owned companies such as Chevron, Peabody, Shell, and BHP Billiton. Thirty-one are state-owned companies such as Saudi Aramco and Statoil, and nine are government-run industries in countries such as China, Poland, and the former Soviet Union""10. These extractive companies make huge profits at the same time as they strongly contribute to climate change which especially impacts the global South. Under the current rules this implies to a large extent a ""privatisation"" of profits and a externalisation of its costs, leading to extreme climate injustice. "

Abstract
Fossil-fuel combustion by-products are the world’s most significant threat to children’s health and future and are major contributors to global inequality and environmental injustice. The emissions include a myriad of toxic air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the most important human-produced climate-altering greenhouse gas. Synergies between air pollution and climate change can magnify the harm to children. Impacts include impairment of cognitive and behavioral development, respiratory illness, and other chronic diseases—all of which may be “seeded“ in utero and affect health and functioning immediately and over the life course. By impairing children’s health, ability to learn, and potential to contribute to society, pollution and climate change cause children to become less resilient and the communities they live in to become less equitable. The developing fetus and young child are disproportionately affected by these exposures because of their immature defense mechanisms and rapid development, especially those in low- and middle-income countries where poverty and lack of resources compound the effects. No country is spared, however: even high-income countries, especially low-income communities and communities of color within them, are experiencing impacts of fossil fuel-related pollution, climate change and resultant widening inequality and environmental injustice. Global pediatric health is at a tipping point, with catastrophic consequences in the absence of bold action. Fortunately, technologies and interventions are at hand to reduce and prevent pollution and climate change, with large economic benefits documented or predicted. All cultures and communities share a concern for the health and well-being of present and future children: this shared value provides a politically powerful lever for action. The purpose of this commentary is to briefly review the data on the health impacts of fossil-fuel pollution, highlighting the neurodevelopmental impacts, and to briefly describe available means to achieve a low-carbon economy, and some examples of interventions that have benefited health and the economy.

1. Introduction
Children, and especially the poor, bear a disproportionate burden of disease and developmental impairment from both environmental pollution and climate change due to the combustion of coal, oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas. Assessments of the health and economic costs of the impacts of fossil-fuel combustion by-products on children have typically been fragmented, published in specialized journals and have separately considered air pollution and climate change. This silo effect has precluded a full reckoning of the harm to children that results from a carbon-based economy and has stymied the advancement of properly comprehensive policies to protect this vulnerable group. This commentary calls for a holistic accounting of the harm from fossil-fuel burning. Such an accounting is needed to spur the required global mitigation and action to reduce disparities between regions and socioeconomic classes and address the growing threat to future generations. Unless we act forcefully right now, our children and theirs will inherit an unsustainable world, lacking the essential ecological resources and social stability to support them. A major theme of this commentary is environmental injustice: the disproportionately heavy health and economic burden that falls on the young, the poor, and certain minorities, especially those in developing countries who are most vulnerable to the impacts of toxic air pollutants as well as CO2-driven climate change resulting from the combustion of fossil fuel. Alleviating this burden would bring great and lasting benefits to children and their progeny. In his Encyclical, Laudate Si, Pope Francis concluded that global capitalism, based on the burning of fossil fuels, has created unsustainable consumption and mounting inequity. This warning was also sounded in the recent report of the Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change [1]. To paraphrase the Lancet Commission: government policies and other strategies to reduce dependence on fossil fuel and build sustainable communities represent the biggest opportunity of our century to improve public health, redress inequality and increase the resilience of individuals, communities and the broader society.
In a prior commentary [2], I envisioned fossil fuel as the modern day version of the many-headed Hydra in Greek mythology, inflicting multiple forms of health and developmental harm in children through its emissions of toxic pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2). Were we to slay the hydra by transitioning to sustainable and renewable energy sources for transport, electricity generation, and industry, we would reap lasting benefits for children. These include significantly fewer cases of babies born preterm or with low birth weight, children with cognitive and behavioral disorders, mental-health problems, asthma and other respiratory illness, and potentially cardiovascular disease and cancer—all of which have been linked to toxic air pollutants. Mitigation of climate change would mean fewer children suffering from heat-related disease, malnutrition, infectious disease, physical and psychological trauma, mental-health problems, and respiratory illness. All of these health benefits would occur immediately and play out over the life course, since exposure-related damage, disease, or impairment in early life can affect long-term health and functioning. Of growing concern are the adverse effects on early brain development, impairing children’s ability to learn, hence their future economic productivity and ability to contribute ideas and energy to society. As a result, they, their families and the broader community are less resilient (“able to survive, adapt, and grow in the face of stress and shocks and transform when conditions require”) [3]. Society becomes even less fair, since the children who are most affected are the poor and disadvantaged.
This commentary builds upon a prior review by this author that contains more detail and references [2], updating it with more recent or additional scientific and economic data on the current and projected health impacts of fossil-fuel combustion. A major focus here is on the neurodevelopmental impacts of air toxics and climate change and their combination, because heretofore the effects on the developing brain have been less recognized than the other health impacts of these exposures.
2. The Young Are Especially Vulnerable to Air Pollution and Climate Change
The developing fetus and young child are more biologically and psychologically vulnerable than adults to the many adverse effects of toxic air pollutants and climate change from fossil-fuel combustion. This differential susceptibility is due to their rapid growth, dynamic developmental programming, immature detoxification, immune, and thermoregulatory systems, and their dependence on adult caretakers. The complexity of early development conveys vulnerability to disruption by toxic exposures of all kinds, including toxic pollutants and stress. Like the respiratory and immune systems, the brain continues to develop during infancy through childhood; however, the prenatal period is considered to be the most dynamic. For example, between conception and birth the brain undergoes highly synchronized maturation from the initial formation of the neural tube to the proliferation and migration of the neurons, synaptogenesis, apoptosis or “pruning” of synapses, and the early phase of myelination [4]. Most of the more than 86 billion neurons of the mature brain are formed during the prenatal period [5]. Numerous studies demonstrate that the fetal and early childhood stages are especially vulnerable to both genetic damage and epigenetic dysregulation from exposure to xenobiotics and stress; these molecular effects may have lifelong and transgenerational consequence [6,7,8].
In addition, because children breathe more air per kilogram of body weight than do adults and require three to four times the amount of food on a body-weight basis than adults, they are more exposed to pollutants in air and food [9,10]. Testifying to the differential vulnerability of the young, the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that more than 40% of the burden of environmentally related disease and more than 88% of the burden of climate change is borne by children under 5, although that age group constitutes only 10% of the global population [11,12,13]. The most serious impacts of climate change are occurring in developing countries; however, the entire global population is affected.
3. Fossil-Fuel Combustion is the Major Source of Global Air Pollution and CO2
Globally, the majority of air pollution is generated by the combustion of fossil fuel (coal, diesel fuel, gasoline, oil, and natural gas) for electricity production, heating, transportation, and industry [14]. Worldwide, in 2011, fossil fuels represented 82% of the total primary energy supply [15]. In the US, oil, natural gas, and coal account for 81% of current fuel use [16]. Energy-related fossil-fuel combustion in high- and middle-income countries and biomass burning in low-income countries accounts for most of the global air pollution, generating 85% of airborne respirable particulate pollution and almost all sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions to the atmosphere [17]. Also emitted are black carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), nitrogen and sulfur dioxides, mercury, and volatile chemicals that form ground-level ozone (O3). All are associated with multiple adverse health effects in children.
Air pollution affects practically all countries in the world and all parts of society; only one person in 10 lives in a city that complies with the WHO Air quality guidelines [18]. Household air pollution is an important risk factor for an estimated 2.9 billion people worldwide, especially those in low- and middle-income countries where biomass fuels and coal are commonly burned for cooking and heating [19] In total, about 2 billion children live in areas that exceed the WHO annual guideline for fine particles of 10 ?g/m3 (the concentration of fine particulate matter that constitutes a long-term inhalation hazard) [20]. About 300 million children currently live in areas where outdoor air pollution exceeds international guidelines at least six-fold [21]. These guidelines are likely underestimates, since recent epidemiological studies have reported impacts below these levels.
Globally, although it remains a very important risk, indoor air pollution has been on the decline in recent years due largely to the reduction in use of solid fuels for cooking from around 60% of homes in 1980 to 42% in 2012 [22]. In contrast, ambient air pollution has shown a dramatic rise. Urban ambient air pollution increased by about 8% between 2008 and 2013; and the upward trend is projected to continue [21].
Fossil-fuel combustion is also the major human source of the greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants that drive climate change. As stated in a recent US interagency report: “Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are primarily responsible for the observed climate changes in the industrial era, especially over the last six decades” [23]. Human activities emit about 35 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year, primarily from energy use [24]. The Annual Greenhouse Gas Index, which is used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to track the warming influence of long-lived climate-altering greenhouse gases, increased by 40% from 1990 to 2016, with most of that increase attributable to rising CO2 levels [25]. CO2 levels in the atmosphere are at their highest in 800,000 years [26]. In the US, coal and natural gas are the largest contributors to carbon pollution (constituting a third of all domestic carbon emissions). Methane released by production of natural gas, oil, and coal is second in importance. Although natural gas emits significantly less toxic air pollution and CO2 than the other fossil fuels [27], the drilling, extraction, and transportation of natural gas results in the leakage of methane that is 34 times more effective than CO2 at trapping heat over a 100-year period [28]. Given its increasing share of total fuel use, natural gas is expected to surpass coal as a source of energy-related CO2 emissions in the US [29].
According to the International Energy Agency, worldwide growth in coal consumption is predicted to decline between 2015 and 2021 as developed countries continue to abandon coal as an energy source and China’s consumption plateaus. However, that decline will be offset by growing demand among emerging nations, particularly in India and south-east Asia. Based on the assumption of business as usual, the US Energy Information Administration predicts that coal will remain the second-largest energy source worldwide, following petroleum and other liquid fuels, until 2030; and from 2030 through 2040, it will be the third-largest energy source, surpassed only by liquid fuels and natural gas [30]. In the US and some other countries, carbon emissions from cars and trucks have exceeded carbon emissions from electric power [31].
4. Fossil-Fuel Combustion-Related Air Pollutants and Climate Change are a Major Cause of Environmental Injustice
A major environmental injustice is that children, who are dependent on adults and did not create the problems, bear the brunt of the impacts of air pollution and climate change. It is a further injustice that children in low- and middle-income countries as well as lower-income communities and communities of color in high-income countries like the US are disproportionately affected. Echoing an earlier WHO finding, the recent report of the Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health, on which this author was a commissioner, stated that pollution in all its forms disproportionately affects the poor and marginalized in every country worldwide, with air pollution being the largest contributor to pollution-related deaths, mainly in low- and middle-income countries [32]. Low- and middle-income countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions had the greatest air pollution-related burden in 2012, with a total of 2.6 million deaths related to outdoor air pollution and 3.3 million deaths linked to indoor air pollution [33]. However, in contrast to pollution-related deaths, which largely occur among adults over 60, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) resulting from pollution-related disease are highly concentrated among infants and young children, reflecting the vulnerability of the young and the many years of life lost with each death of a child [34].
Two factors contribute to the socioeconomic disparities in the impacts of air pollution: differential exposure and heightened susceptibility. Globally, there is a notable pattern of disproportionate exposure of the poor and of certain racial/ethnic groups to air pollution. Studies have shown that low-income communities and communities of color in the US experience disproportionately high exposure to particulate air pollution and air pollution from coal-fired power plants [2]. A GIS-based study of over 150,000 children in the US found that the distribution of three stationary and mobile air-pollution sources followed a consistent pattern of racial inequity, with Hispanic and black children facing significantly higher levels of potential exposure than white children [35]. With respect to heightened susceptibility, an analysis of the Mexico City scenario concluded that low socioeconomic status (SES) children in that megacity are not only exposed to high levels of pollution buttend to have inadequate nutrition and deficient schools, and often face domestic, school and street violence . Because these co-factors make children more vulnerable to air toxins, the significant impact of high air pollution is likely affecting predominantly low SES children in Mexico City [36].
The same factors contribute to disparities in the impacts of climate change. It is the poor who are most often forced to live in areas that are especially vulnerable to extreme flooding, drought and other impacts of climate change. Poor children are also less buffered and less resilient in the face of climate change: “a child living in poverty or deprived of adequate water and sanitation before a crisis will be more affected by a flood, drought or storm, less likely to recover quickly and at even greater risk in a subsequent crisis” [37]. Pre-existing inadequate nutrition, lack of adequate social support, and psychosocial stress due to poverty magnify the effects of both climate change and air pollution. Worldwide, the number of children living in poverty is staggering: one billion children, almost half of the 2.2 billion children below 15 years of age, are living in poverty [38]. In the US, the world’s most prosperous country, the child poverty rate is a shocking 22%. As will be discussed, our research following parallel birth cohorts in the US and Poland has found that co-exposure of pregnant women to air pollution and social stress or hardship due to poverty significantly increases the adverse effect of air pollution on children’s IQ and behavioral problems including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [39,40,41]. For example, our research in Poland found evidence of significant interactions between maternal demoralization during pregnancy, itself correlated with material hardship, and prenatal air-pollution exposure on children’s behavioral problems [41]. In our NYC research, combined prenatal exposure to PAH and material hardship was associated with a significant reduction in the IQ of children [39].
5. The Health Impacts of Air Pollution in Children Include Mortality and Neurodevelopmental Problems
The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health [32] noted that air pollution remains one of the great killers of our age, echoing an earlier conclusion by the WHO that: “Air pollution, both ambient (outdoor) and household (indoor), is a public health emergency” and the biggest environmental risk to health. Most of the attention has been on excess mortality in the overall population, with the largest number of deaths in adults [33,42]. However, in children under 5 years’ old, 1.7 million deaths are attributed to pollution and environmental risks in general; with air pollution linked to 600,000 of these deaths each year, largely due to pneumonia [37,43]. Because of the increasing trend in outdoor air-pollution levels, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), under-5 mortality could be 50% higher than—or even double—current estimates by 2050 as a result of outdoor air pollution [22]. It is predicted that by 2050 outdoor air pollution will become the leading cause of child death [37]. However, millions more children are affected by chronic illness, including respiratory illness other than pneumonia and effects on physical and cognitive development [37].
A previous commentary by this author reviewed in some detail the documented effects of combustion-related air pollution on multiple outcomes including adverse birth outcomes, respiratory illness, and cancer [2]. Here the focus is on neurodevelopmental impacts, an area that has been under-recognized. Low birth weight and preterm birth will be briefly discussed in the context of child neurodevelopment.
A growing body of evidence indicates that early-life exposure to combustion-related air pollutants adversely affects children’s cognitive and behavioral development. There are inconsistencies in the results among studies that can be explained in part by differences in measures used and levels of air pollution, in race/ethnicity, potentially in susceptibility, and in methods to assess children’s neurodevelopment.
Particulate matter (PM) and traffic-related pollutants: Many studies have assessed the associations between PM or traffic-related air pollutants and cognitive outcomes in children from cohorts in the US, Europe and Asia [44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54]. The studies relied on estimates of exposure to PM or traffic-related pollutants (black carbon or nitrogen dioxide/NO2) largely based on land-use regression models, distance of the maternal residence during pregnancy to roadways, or traffic density. Although the results for PM have been mixed, most of the studies on traffic-related pollutant exposure have reported associations with decreased mental and psychomotor development. Several studies found that the two traffic-related pollutants were associated with reductions in children’s memory and IQ, after sociodemographic factors were taken into account [52,53]. Exposure to traffic pollution in childhood has also been linked to slower brain maturation [55].
With respect to attention problems, a study in Boston found more such problems with higher exposure to fine, respirable particulate matter having an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), during the sensitive periods of gestation, with differences between boys and girls [56]. Studies in South Korea and Japan also reported more attentional problems with higher prenatal exposure to PM or other pollutants [57,58]. The association with prenatal exposure to traffic-related air pollutants was not observed in German cohort studies; but there was a significant association between higher PM2.5 levels at the children’s current addresses and increased hyperactivity/inattention scores [45].
Air pollution, mainly PM2.5 or traffic-related pollution, has been associated in a number of studies with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) [59,60,61,62,63]. In contrast, European studies reported no association with autistic traits [64,65]. Although studies have not all been consistent, there is growing evidence that prenatal exposure to traffic-related air pollutants and PM2.5 may be risk factors for ASD [66,67,68].
There is some evidence using molecular biomarkers and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain that chronic exposure to airborne pollutants in the early years may contribute to neurodegenerative disease processes including Alzheimers’s disease [69,70]. In Mexico City, researchers have reported distinct brain changes that have been associated with adult neurodegenerative disease in children living in high air-pollution areas [69].
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH): PAH are a class of neurotoxic air pollutants that my colleagues and I have studied with respect to cognitive and behavioral outcomes and mood disorders in complementary cohort studies in New York City, Krakow, Poland and Chongqing, China [39,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88] In our NYC cohort, prenatal exposure to PAH measured by personal air-monitoring or biomarkers of PAH exposure in cord or maternal blood was associated with developmental delay, reduced IQ, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and inattention, ADHD, deficient maturation of emotional self–regulation capacity, and poorer social responsiveness in childhood. Significant interactions were observed between prenatal PAH and material hardship due to poverty on child IQ [39] and between prenatal PAH and maternal psychological distress on mood-related problems [2]. More recently, significant combined effects of PAH and material hardship have been observed on ADHD outcomes [40]. MRI brain imaging of a subset of children in the NYC cohort showed significant correlations between measures of prenatal PAH exposure and distinct anatomical changes [80].
An example of the neurodevelopmental benefits of reducing air-pollution levels is provided by our research in Tongliang, China, that compared a cohort born before the closure of a centrally located coal power plant to a cohort conceived after plant closure. The second cohort had more favorable birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, significantly lower cord blood levels of the biomarker of exposure measured in cord blood (PAH-DNA adducts), higher levels of a protein important in early brain development known as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and longer telomeres, a general marker of health [89,90].
In addition to their immediate toll, preterm birth and low birth weight are known risk factors for a number of neurodevelopmental disorders in children [91]. Recent studies confirm the reproductive effects of air pollution, their socioeconomic and racial disparities and the large cost imposed on affected families, furthering socioeconomic inequality and increasing the risk of neurodevelopmental effects in vulnerable populations. For example, a large prospective study in China found a significant increase in preterm birth with each 5 µg/m3 increase in maternal exposure to PM2.5 during the pregnancy [92]. A recent analysis found that about 2.7 million premature births per year (18% of preterm births) globally are associated with PM2.5 exposure, including from fossil-fuel and biomass burning, mostly in developing countries [93]. A recent multi-country study concluded that, across all study populations, maternal exposure to particulate pollution was associated with low birth weight at term [94]. Racial disparities exist. In the US, preterm birth rates are 7.4% among Non-Hispanic white infants compared to 17.2% for Non-Hispanic black infants. Both social and physical environmental factors contribute to these disparities [95]. These effects are costly to society and individuals. In the US alone, PM2.5 caused an estimated 15,000 preterm births in 2010, costing about $5 billion in medical care, special education services and lost economic productivity for that single year’s cohort [96].
6. Climate Change is Linked to Serious Health Impacts in Children Including Mortality and Developmental Impairment
As noted in the Introduction, references for this section can be found in [2]. Increased illness, injury, and deaths from heat stress, floods, drought, and increased frequency of forest fires and intense storms are among the direct effects of climate change. The indirect effects include malnutrition and under-nutrition, the spread of infectious-disease vectors, food insecurity, illness due to increased air pollution and aeroallergens, and mental ill health from displacement, social and political instability. Children are especially vulnerable to both the indirect and direct consequences of climate change.
There is broad scientific agreement that climate change has already taken a significant toll on children and that the impacts will increase dramatically unless forceful action is taken. The WHO estimated that climate change since the mid-1970s contributed to about 5 million lost DALYs world-wide in 2000 through malnutrition, diarrhea, and malaria, mostly in children and in developing countries. The toll is expected to rise to 175 million children affected each year in the next several years. These numbers are substantial underestimates since they reflect only a few of the health effects from climate change.
Children bearing the greatest burden of climate-sensitive diseases are those living in regions with the least capacity to adapt to risks—regions that have contributed the least in terms of global emissions of greenhouse gases. Although children in developing countries bear the brunt, the impacts of climate change are increasingly being seen in the US and Europe, especially among populations of low socioeconomic status.
Virtually all of the impacts of climate change can affect children’s neurodevelopment, cognitive functioning, behavior, and mental health, either directly or indirectly. Further, as with air pollution, the impacts are likely to be felt over the lifetime, affecting resilience, health and productivity. Climate change impacts the development of children’s brains in many ways. Malnutrition during the first 1000 days causes stunting of the brain and body, with associated reduced neurodevelopmental and cognitive function in children and subsequent decreased ability to learn and be economically productive [97]. In 2017, 155 million children under five (1 in 4 children) are stunted due to hunger [98].
Stress from extreme weather events also contributes to neurodevelopmental and mental health problems in children. Although no single extreme weather event, such as floods, droughts, wildfires, or hurricanes and cyclones, can be attributed directly to climate change, human-induced climate change is contributing to the frequency and severity of such events. Over the last several decades, there have also been more intense and frequent heat waves as well as marked regional changes in floods, droughts and wildfires in certain parts of the US and globally [99]. An estimated 66.5 million children world-wide were directly affected by weather-related disasters every year from 1990–2000, of whom 600,000 died. Sea-level rise due to global climate warming has made coastal storms increasingly dangerous for coastal infrastructure and inhabitants, contributing to deaths from drowning. Drowning is a major cause of fatality in children in developing countries. According to a recent study, rates of sea-level rise between 1993 and 2011 exceeded by 60% the highest projections made in 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In 2017, the NOAA estimated that the sea-level rise by the end of this century could reach as high as 6.5 feet, enough to inundate many waterfront cities around the globe [100]. Notable extreme weather events in the last decade include the massive flooding across south-east Asia in 2011 which affected an estimated 9.6 million people, many of them children [101]. In the US, Hurricane Katrina in 2005 forced 1 million people in New Orleans from their homes and left 372,000 children without schools; and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 affected people in 8 countries including 24 states in the US, with particularly severe damage in New Jersey and New York. Children who were affected by Hurricane Katrina were found to have higher rates of anxiety and depression [102]. Most recently, in September 2017 Hurricane Irma devastated islands in the Caribbean; and massive flooding in South Asia placed almost 16 million children in urgent need of life-saving support [103]. While populations of all economic statuses have been impacted, these events have most seriously affected the children in low-income communities.
The psychological and emotional impacts of climate change include the acute, traumatic effects of extreme weather events, mental and emotional distress resulting from direct experience or anxiety about future risks, chronic stress from heat, drought, forced migrations, and climate-related conflicts, and the stress of adjustment in the wake of weather-related disasters. Migration and population displacement as a result of social and political instability due to climate change affects the mental health of children in low-income, developing countries, contributing to the perpetuation of poverty and civil unrest. These countries, in which children less than 18 years’ old represent 50% of their population, already bear most of the global burden of poverty and childhood disease.
7. Prenatal or Childhood Exposure to Air Toxics and Climate Change Can Have Long-Term and Synergistic or Combined Health Impacts
By launching a trajectory of adverse effects following the initial physical or developmental impairment, and/or by “seeding” latent disease that only becomes evident in later life, toxic air pollutants can affect health and functioning over the life-course. For example, adverse reproductive outcomes associated with in utero environmental exposures are risk factors "
"Petroleum literally means 'rock oil'. It exists in the upper strata of the Earth's crust, and is mainly a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. Today, petroleum has transformed the world we live in. It provides the bulk of our energy and fuel requirements

 In fact, petroleum accounts for 90 percent of the world's transportation requirement. It has made possible the manufacture and availability of varied consumer products, revolutionised travel and contributed to quality of life in many other ways.

Stop over at Enviroliteracy.org's section on petroleum for more information of this valuable resource and also for links on the subject. Despite being a priceless resource and central to human life on Earth today, extraction and transportation of petroleum products has a number of ecological repercussions, not all of them positive. Even though new technology has addressed some of these problems to various extents, of most serious impacts of petroleum use is on global climate change.

As a fossil fuel, its combustion contributes to polluting emissions, especially of carbon dioxide, one of the most dangerous of the greenhouse gases. Human contributions of greenhouse gases have modified the atmospheric greenhouse layer, which plays an important role in moderating global temperatures.

Because of these concerns, there is considerable interest in reducing our reliance on petroleum-based technologies. Encarta has a quite comprehensive section on petroleum, its production, extraction and impact on the environment.

The future of oil production depends on demand, availability of acceptable alternatives and environmental concerns. There are fears that the production of oil globally is likely to decline in the next few years.

However, as of today, there are no viable alternatives to petroleum-based technologies that are cost-effective and likely to be adopted on a large scale. Although there is considerable research undergoing to develop new, effective energy technologies, in the short run petroleum will a major energy source.

One of the major concerns associated with petroleum use, in addition to the emissions associated with combustion of fossil fuels, is the environmental impacts associated with extracting petroleum and with transporting it. HowStuffWorks.com tells you all about how oil is drilled and refined."
"Energy demand is peaking due to rapid industrialization and urbanization. Fossil fuels constitute the major source of energy in today’s world, which comprises coal, petroleum, and gas from coal seams, shale, and hydrates. Fossil fuel exploration, extraction, transportation, and usage have several environmental impacts. Each stage of the fossil fuel life cycle poses several risks to the environment. During exploration, clearance of land cover aggravates erosion and soil contamination. Drilling for oil and gas can lead to blowouts causing oil spills which are an environmental disaster. Leakage during transportation of oil in subsea pipelines or container vessels also damages the environment. Extraction, transportation, and usage of coal, which is a cheap form of fossil fuel, have several health and environmental hazards. Coal seam gas extraction impacts ground water levels. Shale gas, whose production is now an all-time high, uses fracking which has its own risks for groundwater contamination and microseismic events. Gas hydrates, which are abundant in the seafloor, are a major cause of concern in the wake of global warming as its escape into the atmosphere 246could aggravate climate change. It is therefore important to have a comprehensive understanding of the potential environmental impacts of fossil fuels and address them through technological interventions making the exploration, extraction, transportation, and usage in environmentally friendly manner for making our Earth sustainable for future generations."
"Humans need energy for just about any type of function they perform. Houses must be heated, energy is required for industry and agriculture and even within our own bodies a constant flow of energy takes place. All processes that provide us with the luxuries of every day live we can no longer live without require energy generation. This is an industrial process that can be performed using various different sources. These sources can be either renewable or non-renewable. Renewable energy sources are replaced in time and will therefore not run out easily. However, non-renewable energy sources are threatening to run out if our standard of usage becomes too high.

Nowadays many renewable energy sources are available for use, for example solar and wind energy and water power. Ironically, we still gain most of our energy from non-renewable energy sources, commonly known as fossil fuels (figure 1). The non-renewability of these sources will probably cause prices to rise up to a point where they are no longer economically feasible.




Figure 1: fossil fuel combustion is part of the carbon cycle (right)


Fossil fuels consist of deposits of once living organisms. The organic matter takes centuries to form. Fossil fuels principally consist of carbon and hydrogen bonds. There are three types of fossil fuels which can all be used for energy provision; coal, oil and natural gas. Coal is a solid fossil fuel formed over millions of years by decay of land vegetation. When layers are compacted and heated over time, deposits are turned into coal. Coal is quite abundant compared to the other two fossil fuels. Analysts sometimes predict that worldwide coal use will increase as oil supplies become scarcer. Current coal supplies could last for 200 years or more. Coal is usually extracted in mines. Since the middle of the 20th century, coal use has doubled. Since 1996 its application is declining again. Many developing countries depend on coal for energy provision because they cannot afford oil or natural gas. China and India are major users of coal for energy provision.
Oil is a liquid fossil fuel that is formed from the remains of marine microorganisms deposited on the sea floor. After millions of years the deposits end up in rock and sediment where oil is trapped in small spaces. It can be extracted by large drilling platforms. Oil is the most widely used fossil fuel. Crude oil consists of many different organic compounds which are transformed to products in a refining process. It is applied in cars, jets, roads and roofs and many other. Oil cannot be found everywhere on earth and consequentially, there have been wars on oil supplies. A well-known example is the Gulf War of 1991.
Natural gas is a gaseous fossil fuel that is versatile, abundant and relatively clean compared to coal and oil. Like oil, it is formed from the remains of marine microorganisms. It is a relatively new type of energy source. Until 1999, more coal was used than natural gas. Natural gas has now overtaken coal in developed countries. However, people are afraid that like oil, natural gas supplies will run out. Some scientists have even predicted this might happen by the middle or end of the 21st century. Natural gas mainly consists of methane (CH4). It is highly compressed in small volumes at large depths in the earth. Like oil, it is brought to the surface by drilling. Natural gas reserves are more evenly distributed around the globe than oil supplies.

Energy gained from burning fossil fuels is converted to electricity and heat in commercial power plants. When fossil fuels are burned carbon and hydrogen react with oxygen in air to carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). During this reaction heat is released which further amplifies the reaction. Electricity is generated by transforming mechanical energy (heat) to electrical energy in a turbine or generator. Power plants are very expensive to build, but once they are present efficiency in converting fuel to energy is very high. Most of the time more electricity is created than is actually needed, because electricity cannot be stored. Electricity demands vary throughout the year and provision must meet the peak load, which means the highest possible demand within a year. If demands significantly exceed a power plant's capacity to generate energy this may cause temporary blackouts.

Historically, fossil fuels were available in plentiful supply that was easy to obtain and transport. But now signals are given that the supply is running out and that it will take centuries to be replenished. Both sources and sinks of fossil fuels are limiting in their use. Sources are deep earth layers and sinks are for example air and water, which absorb fossil fuel waste products.
Burning fossil fuels is responsible for environmental issues that are high on the political agenda these days. Examples are greenhouse gas accumulation, acidification, air pollution, water pollution, damage to land surface and ground-level ozone. These environmental problems are caused by release of pollutants that are naturally present in fossil fuel structures, such as sulphur and nitrogen. Currently, oil burning is responsible for about 30% of all carbon dioxide emissions to air. Natural gas does not release as much carbon dioxide because of its methane structure. The largest emissions are cause by coal combustion. Coal may result in underground fires that are virtually impossible to extinguish. Coal dust can even explode. This makes coal mining a very dangerous profession. Oil may end up in soil or water in raw form, for example during oil spills or wars. This has caused many natural disasters in the past.

Why than are we still using fossil fuels to such a large extend? The answer is simple; because this is cheaper than any type of reasonable alternative we now know. Some environmental scientists predict that fossil fuel prices will increase in the coming century because of scarcity. This may cause an eventual transfer to renewable energy sources. According to Bjorn Lomborg, this will eventually happen. The IPCC is not sure whether a fossil fuel future can be entirely ruled out."
"Climate change is an existential threat to the vast global permafrost domain. The diverse human cultures, ecological communities, and biogeochemical cycles of this tenth of the planet depend on the persistence of frozen conditions. The complexity, immensity, and remoteness of permafrost ecosystems make it difficult to grasp how quickly things are changing and what can be done about it. Here, we summarize terrestrial and marine changes in the permafrost domain with an eye toward global policy. While many questions remain, we know that continued fossil fuel burning is incompatible with the continued existence of the permafrost domain as we know it. If we fail to protect permafrost ecosystems, the consequences for human rights, biosphere integrity, and global climate will be severe. The policy implications are clear: the faster we reduce human emissions and draw down atmospheric CO2, the more of the permafrost domain we can save. Emissions reduction targets must be strengthened and accompanied by support for local peoples to protect intact ecological communities and natural carbon sinks within the permafrost domain. Some proposed geoengineering interventions such as solar shading, surface albedo modification, and vegetation manipulations are unproven and may exacerbate environmental injustice without providing lasting protection. Conversely, astounding advances in renewable energy have reopened viable pathways to halve human greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and effectively stop them well before 2050. We call on leaders, corporations, researchers, and citizens everywhere to acknowledge the global importance of the permafrost domain and work towards climate restoration and empowerment of Indigenous and immigrant communities in these regions.

Introduction
Though permafrost-affected regions cover only 10% of Earth’s surface, they constitute more than half of all remaining terrestrial and marine wilderness (Watson et al., 2018), making them crucial to maintaining biosphere integrity in our rapidly changing world. These regions, which we refer to as the permafrost domain (Figure 1), contain between 2.5 and 3 trillion tons of organic carbon—more than all of Earth’s other life, soil, and atmosphere combined (Hugelius et al., 2014; Abbott et al., 2016b; Sayedi et al., 2020; Mishra et al., 2021; Abbott B. W., 2022; Schuur et al., 2022). The permafrost domain is home to tens of millions of people, including diverse Indigenous and immigrant cultures that both depend on and sustain these globally-significant ecosystems (Riedlinger and Berkes, 2001; Parkinson and Berner, 2009; Pearce et al., 2009; Chapin et al., 2013; Díaz et al., 2019; Proverbs et al., 2020; Ellis et al., 2021; Mettiäinen et al., 2022). The permafrost domain’s three-fold importance—biodiversity, climate, and human peoples—means that governments, corporations, and communities within and outside of these regions must commit to preventing dangerous environmental change (Chapin and Díaz, 2020; Whyte, 2020; Chapin, 2021; Natali et al., 2021; Arctic Council, 2022).

FIGURE 1. The extent and example futures of the permafrost domain (A) Our definition of the domain includes marine and terrestrial regions substantially affected by perennial frozen material, including oceans and seas above 50°N, subsea permafrost on the continental shelves, Arctic tundra, Boreal forest, and Alpine permafrost. The figure shows potential permafrost futures for (B) a rapid decarbonization scenario and (C) a continued fossil energy scenario. Panel B depicts: 1. Resilient biological communities in marine, coastal, and terrestrial environments, 2. Persistence of sea ice, especially crucial multiyear and landfast ice, 3. Maintenance of net greenhouse gas uptake in the permafrost domain, 4. Recovery of permafrost and a shallow active layer, and 5. Preservation of human cultural activities and infrastructure. Panel C depicts: 6. Expansion of fossil fuel extraction and marine navigation, 7. Disruption of food webs, migrations, and biological communities on sea and land, 8. Accelerated coastal erosion, aquatic and marine primary productivity, ocean acidification, and erosion of terrestrial material, including pollutants, 9. Transition to net release of greenhouse gases (CH4, N2O, and CO2), 10. Extensive permafrost degradation, including active-layer thickening and lake formation and draining, 11. Intensifying terrestrial disturbances including wildfire, hydrological extremes, thermokarst, vegetation shifts, and invasive species, 12. Profound disruption of human culture and infrastructure.

The permafrost domain is uniquely vulnerable to climate change because of accelerated warming and the prevalence of ice. Air temperature in the permafrost domain over land and sea has risen two to four times faster than the global mean, largely because of ice and snow loss, changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation, and the effects of ozone-depleting gases (Huang et al., 2017; Goosse et al., 2018; Mu et al., 2020a; Polvani et al., 2020; AMAP, 2021). Ice in all its forms underpins and overlays the permafrost domain, and its loss disrupts energy balance, ecosystem structure, and human activity (Bamber et al., 2018; Schuur and Mack, 2018; Bamber et al., 2019; Turetsky et al., 2020; Schmidt et al., 2021; Irrgang et al., 2022). Consequently, climate change is intensifying disturbance regimes across the permafrost domain and restructuring socioecological dynamics at continental scales (Hjort et al., 2018; Chou et al., 2021; Veraverbeke et al., 2021; Treharne et al., 2022). In many regions, these changes are progressing decades faster than expected (Farquharson et al., 2019; Angelopoulos et al., 2021; Parkinson and DiGirolamo, 2021), likely heralding the transition of the permafrost domain into unprecedented biophysical and socioecological states (Box et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019; Meredith et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021).

Pervasive and interconnected changes in the permafrost domain are triggering complex local biogeochemical responses with global repercussions. The ongoing release of large amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) from permafrost soils, sediments, and waterways has motivated substantial research and attracted public attention (Schuur et al., 2015; Andreassen et al., 2017; Kessler, 2017; Froitzheim et al., 2021; Treharne et al., 2022). The production and release of CO2, CH4, and N2O occur during the decomposition or combustion of organic matter in terrestrial and aquatic environments (Schädel et al., 2016; Plaza et al., 2019; Voigt et al., 2020; Abbott B. W., 2022). Additionally, CH4 can escape from subsea or subterranean fossil reserves or hydrate deposits, particularly during disturbance from permafrost thaw or fossil-fuel exploration and extraction (Walter et al., 2008; Thornton et al., 2016; Behari et al., 2020; Sayedi et al., 2020; Froitzheim et al., 2021).

The release of GHGs and loss of surface ice and snow from the permafrost domain constitute some of the largest destabilizing climate feedbacks globally (Schaefer et al., 2012; Schuur et al., 2015; Hugelius, 2022). These feedbacks are very likely to be nonlinear, with the amount of GHG production and albedo change often exponentially related to temperature (Abbott et al., 2016b; Carey et al., 2016; Turetsky et al., 2020; AMAP, 2021). The potential magnitude and timing of such amplifying permafrost climate feedbacks remain highly uncertain but could amount to several hundred gigatons (Gt) of CO2 equivalent over the next two centuries (Schuur et al., 2015, 2022; McGuire et al., 2018; Meredith et al., 2019; Sayedi et al., 2020; Canadell et al., 2021). GHG emissions from the permafrost domain are already similar to the annual emissions of Japan (Hugelius, 2022). Until recently, permafrost domain GHG release was omitted from the Earth system models (ESMs) used to predict climate change trajectories and inform international climate targets (Canadell et al., 2021; Natali et al., 2021). New ESMs are beginning to integrate permafrost carbon feedbacks, but estimates remain preliminary and lack a number of important processes (Abbott et al., 2016b; McGuire et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2020; de Vrese and Brovkin, 2021; Natali et al., 2021).

The combination of growing scientific attention and persistent socio-ecological complexity has created polarized and incomplete perceptions about permafrost in public and policymaker circles (Table 1). In this paper, we review permafrost climate responses with a focus on mitigation. The sections below highlight how climate change and other human disturbances are affecting the physical, biological, and social fabric of the permafrost domain. These examples are not comprehensive, and we remind all readers that these regions are composed of diverse ecosystems and peoples with unique histories and ecological contexts (Jorgenson et al., 2013; Chapin, 2020; Tank et al., 2020; Turetsky et al., 2020; Arctic Council, 2022).

Unstable Footing: Terrestrial Permafrost Degradation
Permanently frozen ground or permafrost has developed in cold regions primarily in the Northern Hemisphere (Figure 1). The formation and degradation of permafrost depends on complex interactions between local climate and ecosystem characteristics, especially vegetation, water, and glacial history (Shur and Jorgenson, 2007; Lindgren et al., 2018; Loranty et al., 2018). Because of unique soil processes, the permafrost domain has accumulated much of the Earth’s freshwater, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and pollutants such as mercury transported from lower latitudes by the atmosphere and rivers (Fisher et al., 2012; Hugelius et al., 2014; Strauss et al., 2017; Malone et al., 2018; Schuster et al., 2018; Abbott et al., 2019; Voigt et al., 2020). For example, cold and waterlogged soils slow microbial decomposition, and periglacial processes can incorporate materials that are produced or deposited on the surface much deeper in the soil than in other regions (Lindgren et al., 2018; FAO, 2021; Finger and Rekvig, 2022).

Soils in the permafrost domain are warming worldwide (Biskaborn et al., 2019; Neumann et al., 2019; Miner et al., 2021; Smith et al., 2022) because of higher air temperature, vegetation shifts, loss of snow and ice cover, surface disturbances, and intensification of the hydrological cycle (Rawlins et al., 2010; Stevens and Latimer, 2015; Forbes et al., 2016; Egelkraut et al., 2018; Loranty et al., 2018; Kropp et al., 2020). Deeper and longer thaw stimulates microbial decomposition—the main driver of GHG release from the permafrost domain (Treat et al., 2015; Schädel et al., 2016; Natali et al., 2019; Voigt et al., 2020; Treharne et al., 2022). Nutrients, trace elements, and pollutants are also released during soil warming, affecting plant growth, microbial activity, and human health (Keuper et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2018; Hewitt et al., 2018; Carey et al., 2019; UNEP, 2019; Mu et al., 2020b; Yang et al., 2021; Basu et al., 2022). While increased nutrient availability and CO2 fertilization have long been predicted to enhance plant uptake of atmospheric CO2, observed trends of primary productivity in the permafrost domain have been mixed because of vegetation shifts, droughts, and other disturbances (Forbes et al., 2010; Hayes et al., 2011; Abbott et al., 2016b; McGuire et al., 2018; Rocha et al., 2018; Myers-Smith et al., 2020; Bruhwiler et al., 2021; Mack et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2021; Vitali et al., 2022).

Terrestrial disturbances in the permafrost domain are intensifying, including wildfire, surface subsidence (thermokarst), and direct human disturbance from resource extraction, grazing, and infrastructure. Lengthening dry periods, vegetation shifts, and more lightning are increasing Boreal and Arctic wildfire, with effects on local habitat, air quality, and regional carbon and nutrient cycles (Masrur et al., 2018; Box et al., 2019; Rodríguez-Cardona et al., 2020; Abbott et al., 2021b; Chen et al., 2021; Mack et al., 2021). In addition to directly producing CO2 and CH4 during combustion, wildfires warm soil through loss of insulating vegetation and albedo changes. This can stimulate organic matter decomposition and hydrological export for decades after the wildfire (Grosse et al., 2011; Rocha and Shaver, 2011; Carey et al., 2019; Meredith et al., 2019; Abbott et al., 2021b; Bruhwiler et al., 2021). Permafrost wildfires are expanding northward and even burning through the winter (Holloway et al., 2020; McCarty et al., 2020; Scholten et al., 2021; Veraverbeke et al., 2021; Talucci et al., 2022).

In areas with ground ice, soil warming often triggers abrupt surface collapse, mass wasting, and coastal erosion (Kokelj and Jorgenson, 2013; Olefeldt et al., 2016; Grotheer et al., 2020; Angelopoulos et al., 2021). These thermokarst processes have a wide range of consequences depending on landscape position and soil characteristics (Mu et al., 2020a; Turetsky et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021), including soil warming, GHG release or uptake, and delivery of sediment and solutes to aquatic ecosystems (Anthony et al., 2014; Abbott et al., 2015; Farquharson et al., 2019; Kokelj et al., 2021; Wologo et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021). Subsidence can result in complex changes in soil moisture, affecting the type and amount of GHGs produced, further complicating estimates of permafrost climate feedbacks (Lupascu et al., 2013; Lawrence et al., 2015; Boike et al., 2016; Schuur et al., 2022). Approximately 20% of the northern permafrost region is vulnerable to thermokarst formation, which can trigger rapid GHG release and damage human infrastructure and wildlife habitat (Olefeldt et al., 2016; Hjort et al., 2018; Turetsky et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2021).

While the permafrost domain generally has low human population density, direct human impacts are extensive and growing. Fossil fuel extraction, logging, peat harvesting, and construction of roads, power lines, and buildings can cause soil warming or collapse by disturbing vegetation and modifying surface conditions, including moisture and albedo (Van Seters and Price, 2001; Kreutzweiser et al., 2008; Lamers et al., 2015; Bartsch et al., 2021; FAO, 2021; Maslakov et al., 2021). Some human activities, such as grazing, can cool or warm soils depending on the intensity of the disturbance and local ecosystem attributes including soil structure and vegetation community (Egelkraut et al., 2018; Beer et al., 2020; FAO, 2021). Many of these large-scale human activities are driven by demand for energy, fiber, and tourism from outside the permafrost domain, adding another layer to the environmental injustice of climate change (Johnson, 2010; Chapin, 2021).

Troubled Waters: Hydrochemical Disruption From Streams to Seas
Though terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments are often considered separately, they are closely coupled climatically, biogeochemically, and culturally (Bhatt et al., 2010; Kling, 2010; Chapin et al., 2013; Forbes et al., 2016; MacDonald et al., 2021). This is especially true in the permafrost domain, where the ground is often held up by frozen water, extensive freshwater networks blur boundaries, and sea ice regulates exchange of energy and material among land, sea, and atmosphere (Campeau et al., 2019; Harms et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019; Shogren et al., 2021). Indeed, much of the marine habitat in the Arctic Ocean still carries thermal and biogeochemical legacies from when it was terrestrial during the Last Glacial Maximum (Figure 1A) (Frederick and Buffett, 2016; Overduin et al., 2019; Angelopoulos et al., 2020; Sayedi et al., 2020). Consequently, terrestrial and marine disturbances are strongly interlinked. For example, the release of sediment, organic matter, and pollutants from degrading permafrost can alter aquatic food webs, influence migrations of marine animals, and expose human communities to biomagnified pollutants (AMAP, 2017; UNEP, 2019). Likewise, loss of sea ice increases atmospheric moisture and energy availability, driving shifts in terrestrial vegetation and likelihood of extreme precipitation events (Bhatt et al., 2010; Forbes et al., 2016).

The Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas (referred to hereafter simply as the Arctic Ocean) play pivotal roles in global climate, ocean circulation, marine and terrestrial biodiversity, and international politics and commerce (Steinacher et al., 2009; Carmack et al., 2016; Chou et al., 2021; Arctic Council, 2022). Like in terrestrial permafrost regions, many changes in the Arctic Ocean are occurring decades faster than predicted (Steinacher et al., 2009; Boers and Rypdal, 2021; Parkinson and DiGirolamo, 2021). Sea ice extent and thickness have plummeted, with summer ice expected to disappear mid-century (IPCC, 2019). Freshwater inputs have increased because of glacial and icesheet melt and climbing river discharge (Bamber et al., 2018; King et al., 2020; Feng et al., 2021). At the same time, terrestrial permafrost degradation and pollution from outside the permafrost domain are substantially altering the delivery of carbon, nutrients, sediment, and pollutants via coastal collapse, river discharge, groundwater flux, and atmospheric transport (Fisher et al., 2012; Tank et al., 2016; Toohey et al., 2016; Fritz et al., 2017; Drake et al., 2018; Connolly et al., 2020; Wologo et al., 2021; Mann et al., 2022).

Coastal erosion and riverine material fluxes are changing particularly rapidly (Fritz et al., 2017; Tank et al., 2020). Coastal collapse has been supercharged by three factors: permafrost degradation, increased wave action from sea ice loss, and intrusions of saltwater (Jones et al., 2009; Lantuit et al., 2012; Berry et al., 2021; Guimond et al., 2021). Coastal erosion rates now exceed 20 m yr?1 in some areas, though differences in local conditions create high spatial variability (Lantuit et al., 2012; Günther et al., 2015; Fritz et al., 2017). Changes in riverine transport are being caused by hydrological intensification, thickening of the seasonally-thawed active layer, widespread thermokarst formation, and changes in plant uptake of water and nutrients (Toohey et al., 2016; Treat et al., 2016; Carey et al., 2019, 2020; Shogren et al., 2020; Tank et al., 2020). Interacting disturbances, such as wildfire, thermokarst formation, and extreme hydrological events can deliver large pulses of material to river networks and Arctic estuaries (Holmes et al., 2012; St. Pierre et al., 2018; Rodríguez-Cardona et al., 2020; Abbott et al., 2021b). For example, in the western Canadian Arctic, mass wasting along fluvial networks has increased two orders of magnitude from 1986–2018, creating sedimentary deposits that will cascade through rivers and lakes to the Arctic Ocean for decades to millennia (Kokelj et al., 2021). Understanding and preventing changes in water chemistry and river discharge are particularly important for the Tibetan Plateau, which provides drinking and agricultural water for 1.4 billion people (Yao et al., 2018; Mu et al., 2020b; Gao et al., 2021).

Riverine and coastal erosion is also releasing trace metals and semi-volatile contaminants from permafrost and active-layer soils (Loiko et al., 2017; Schuster et al., 2018; St. Pierre et al., 2018; Perryman et al., 2020; Basu et al., 2022). These toxic materials include mercury, organochlorines, PAHs, and other compounds that accumulate naturally or from human pollution such as coal combustion and mining (Fisher et al., 2012; AMAP, 2021). The permafrost domain’s aquatic environments are especially vulnerable to these global contaminants largely due to efficient transport pathways and bio-accumulating and biomagnifying processes (Fahnestock et al., 2019). Mercury is of special concern because one of its neurotoxic forms, methylmercury, accumulates in food webs and is found at elevated levels in wildlife and human populations across the circumpolar north (AMAP, 2011; Basu et al., 2022). Because of its strong influence on redox state and bioavailability of metals, the release of terrestrial organic matter may also foster the production and transport of methylmercury in aquatic environments (Stern et al., 2012; Abbott et al., 2016a; Fahnestock et al., 2019).

In addition to altered material flux from terrestrial environments, climate change is affecting the Arctic Ocean directly. The characteristics of the Arctic Ocean make it highly vulnerable to ocean acidification, “the other CO2 problem” (Bates and Mathis, 2009; Doney et al., 2009; AMAP, 2017). Acidic conditions decrease the availability of calcium carbonate, disrupting marine primary and secondary production (Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2009; Denman et al., 2011). Arctic Ocean biogeochemistry is dominated by land-derived runoff, receiving ? 11% of global river runoff while constituting just 1% of ocean volume (McClelland et al., 2012). Consequently, the Arctic Ocean’s cold and poorly-buffered surface waters absorb large quantities of CO2 (Bates and Mathis, 2009; Bruhwiler et al., 2021). The decomposition of terrestrial organic matter adds more CO2, further decreasing pH (Alling et al., 2012; Semiletov et al., 2016; Tanski et al., 2021). Strong vertical stratification and sea ice prevent mixing within the water column and exchange with the atmosphere, resulting in rapid acidification in some of the most vulnerable compartments of the Arctic Ocean (Bates and Mathis, 2009; Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2009; Vonk et al., 2012; Ouyang et al., 2020). The combined effects of rising CO2, increased meltwater inputs, and changes in circulation could push calcium carbonate below critical saturation thresholds in the Arctic Ocean’s surface water by the mid-21st Century (Steinacher et al., 2009; Denman et al., 2011). In combination with increasing thermal stresses, this could trigger major breakdowns in planktonic and benthic food webs (Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2009; Denman et al., 2011; Arrigo et al., 2020). For example, the combination of increased light availability from sea ice loss and changes in water and nutrient delivery from terrestrial ecosystems is estimated to have increased primary productivity in the Arctic Ocean by roughly 60% over the last 20 years (Lewis et al., 2020; Terhaar et al., 2021). This state change could cause the loss of ecological niches and biodiversity in Arctic food webs.

Predicting and Shaping Permafrost Futures
Given the complexity of the permafrost domain and the unprecedented speed of climate change, we do not know the specific timeline and severity of disruption to its peoples, biodiversity, and biogeochemistry (Proverbs et al., 2020; Bruhwiler et al., 2021; Canadell et al., 2021; Fewster et al., 2022; Mann et al., 2022; Versen et al., 2022). For example, the most comprehensive permafrost model intercomparison project (MIP) of carbon balance estimated a range of ?600 Gt of carbon release to ?200 Gt of carbon uptake by the year 2300 (McGuire et al., 2018). Though the divergence of model outputs is clearly problematic, the multi-model mean of this study has become the default reference for comparison (Turetsky et al., 2020; de Vrese and Brovkin, 2021; Natali et al., 2021). These models were state-of-the art seven to 10 years ago, but there have been considerable advances in permafrost domain modeling since then (Randers and Goluke, 2020; Shu et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2021; Wiltshire et al., 2021; Chadburn et al., 2022). This emphasizes the larger problem of the continued exclusion of permafrost in Earth system models. Only 4 of 11 CMIP6 models used for IPCC AR6 included permafrost (IPCC, 2019, 2021), and only two of the 18 models in the Zero Emissions Commitment model intercomparison included permafrost dynamics (MacDougall, 2021).

Because the stakes of environmental change in the permafrost domain are so high for human and nonhuman permafrost communities, we need to use all available tools for monitoring and prediction. For example, recognizing these shortcomings of Earth system models, the IPCC AR6 WG1 estimated permafrost climate feedbacks using a range of different methods, including empirically based studies (Canadell et al., 2021). In research, management, and policymaking, we need to fully integrate traditional ecological knowledge, empirical and model-based evidence, expert assessments, and paleo studies considering the full range of socioecological consequences (Kimmerer, 2002; Sayedi et al., 2020; Chapin, 2021; Arctic Council, 2022). Specifically, we need to consider disruptions and sources of resilience that cascade across ecosystem boundaries (e.g., terrestrial, freshwater, marine) and ecological dimensions (e.g., human wellbeing, biosphere integrity, and biogeochemical cycles). Identified research and management priorities go far beyond questions of carbon balance, including: Arctic Ocean circulation, marine and coastal habitat, destabilization of organic matter and methane clathrates on the continental shelves, thermokarst formation, fire-induced thaw, nutrient interactions, peatland dynamics, and socioecological adaptation and resilience (Lewis et al., 2020; Voigt et al., 2020; FAO, 2021; Finger and Rekvig, 2022; Mettiäinen et al., 2022).

What can we do?
Persistent uncertainty about permafrost processes does not limit our ability to act now to protect the permafrost domain. Across traditional, modeled, and empirical approaches, there is consensus that the timing and degree of damage to the permafrost domain are directly associated with the amount of human-caused warming (Canadell et al., 2021; Abbott B. W., 2022; Cheng et al., 2022; Fewster et al., 2022). The question then becomes, how can we most effectively reduce anthropogenic climate change?

In very general terms, there are three non-exclusive approaches to stopping climate change: 1) Reduce human GHG emissions, 2) Protect ecosystems to sustain natural GHG sinks, and 3) Attempt to control the Earth’s energy balance through geoengineering. The first two approaches are feasible, cost-effective, and come with a wide array of co-benefits (Foley et al., 2011; Breyer et al., 2021; Chapin et al., 2022). For example, eliminating fossil fuel burning could prevent 10.2 million premature deaths each year and add US$10 trillion annually in economic benefits from improved air quality (Errigo et al., 2020; Shindell et al., 2021; Vohra et al., 2021; Abbott B., 2022). Likewise, collaboratively expanding conservation of intact ecosystems enhances biosphere integrity and can restore rights of Indigenous and immigrant peoples of the permafrost domain (Steffen et al., 2018; Watson et al., 2018; Díaz et al., 2019; Bergstrom et al., 2021; Chapin et al., 2022). Unfortunately, the third approach (geoengineering) is both less proven and more prone to unintended consequences (Lawrence et al., 2018; Zarnetske et al., 2021; Mettiäinen et al., 2022; Versen et al., 2022).

A wide suite of geoengineering interventions have been proposed in the permafrost domain, including solar radiation management (SRM), ocean brightening, artificial sea-ice creation, ocean fertilization, biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and biomanipulations such as tree planting and herbivore introductions (Olson, 2012; Harper et al., 2018; Whyte, 2018; Zampieri and Goessling, 2019; Beer et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Zarnetske et al., 2021; Mettiäinen et al., 2022; Versen et al., 2022). While continued research into some of these interventions is merited, all have serious side effects and known ethical and practical limitations (Tuana et al., 2012; Lawrence et al., 2018; Mettiäinen et al., 2022). For example, SRM could theoretically reduce temperatures enough to protect a portion of the permafrost domain (Chen et al., 2020). However, this would not solve acidification of the Arctic Ocean and would very likely disrupt global agriculture while exacerbating the Arctic ozone hole (Tilmes et al., 2008; Proctor et al., 2018; Zarnetske et al., 2021). Likewise, converting portions of the Boreal forest for BECCS could decrease local ecosystem carbon storage while producing pollution that would harm public health and create substantial regional warming from black and brown carbon deposition (Hanssen et al., 2020; Calì Quaglia et al., 2022; Yue et al., 2022). Additionally, many of these proposed solutions may be ineffective or counterproductive in the new conditions created by anthropogenic climate change. For example, the survival of large herds of herbivores could be negatively affected by shifts in forage and extreme weather events (Forbes et al., 2016; Zarnetske et al., 2021), and carbon uptake from tree planting can be erased by temperature-induced mass mortality and an intensifying wildfire regime (Hammond et al., 2022; Talucci et al., 2022). Even if these interventions achieved their climate goals, they would threaten more than half of remaining intact ecosystems globally (Watson et al., 2018; Díaz et al., 2019).

We conclude that rapid reduction of fossil fuel emissions and empowerment of local communities are needed to conserve permafrost ecosystems. While many scientific questions remain about permafrost-climate complexities, we know that the faster the drawdown of atmospheric GHGs, the more of the permafrost domain will be preserved (Canadell et al., 2021; Abbott B. W., 2022). Because of the permafrost domain’s immensity and momentum (Schuur et al., 2015; Lindgren et al., 2018; Biskaborn et al., 2019; Sayedi et al., 2020; de Vrese and Brovkin, 2021), the choices we make over the next decade regarding GHG emissions could either open pathways towards recovery and conservation or lock us into a future of loss and degradation (Figure 1) (King et al., 2020; Ritchie et al., 2021; Abbott B., 2022). Consequently, the future of the permafrost domain depends on energy choices made far beyond its borders.

Thankfully, recent breakthroughs in renewable energy production, transmission, and storage now allow much faster decarbonization than previously believed possible (Bogdanov et al., 2021; Victoria et al., 2021; Jacobson et al., 2022). The costs of solar photovoltaics and wind turbine have plummeted 91 and 71%, respectively since 2009, now providing the cheapest and cleanest electricity ever available to humankind (Abbott et al., 2021a; Breyer et al., 2021; Abbott B., 2022). Global markets have already responded, with renewables constituting 90% of all new electricity capacity built in 2021 (IEA, 2021a) and 95% of all projected growth through 2025 (IEA, 2021b). With doubling periods of 3.7 years for wind and 1.9 years for solar, renewables could meet global electricity demand within 10 years and all primary energy demand within 25 (Rockström et al., 2017; Haegel et al., 2019; Abbott et al., 2021a; Bogdanov et al., 2021; Abbott B., 2022). Mature technologies now allow electrification of nearly the entire economy (transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, etc.), with developing technologies on track to allow full decarbonization before 2040 (Breyer et al., 2021; Jacobson et al., 2022). If the global community commits to sustaining this ongoing transition, the clean and abundant energy will also bring down costs of direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), one of the few scalable and sustainable geoengineering approaches (Breyer et al., 2020). The combination of abrupt global decarbonization and renewable DACCS could enable a return to Holocene-like conditions by the end of the century (Breyer et al., 2021; Abbott B., 2022).

Now that the technology and economics for rapid decarbonization and atmospheric drawdown of CO2 are in place, meeting our moral responsibility to restore the Earth’s climate is in reach. Rather than aiming for 1.5–2 °C of warming—a level of change that would cause radical transformation and widespread destruction throughout the permafrost domain (Farquharson et al., 2019; King et al., 2020; Ritchie et al., 2021)—we must aim for restoring Holocene-like climate conditions by stopping fossil fuel burning while supporting natural GHG sinks and developing negative emissions technologies (Breyer et al., 2020; Abbott B., 2022).

While pursuing abrupt GHG drawdown at global scales, we must support and empower communities in the permafrost domain who are adapting to unprecedented environmental and economic changes, and who are essential to the sustainable conservation of these ecosystems (Díaz et al., 2019; Proverbs et al., 2020; Chapin et al., 2022; Mettiäinen et al., 2022). For both practical and ethical reasons, we need to follow the guidance of the Indigenous and other local"
"America is at an energy crossroad. As a nation, we are dependent on fossil fuels at a time of growing demand and dwindling supply. Meanwhile, fossil fuel use continues to impose massive environmental and economic costs. Now our country must choose between paying to continue the status quo and investing in a new energy future.

The costs of continuing on our current energy path are steep. American consumers and businesses already spend roughly $700 billion to $1 trillion each year on coal, oil and natural gas, and suffer the incalculable costs of pollution from fossil fuels through damage to our health and environment. If America continues along a business-as-usual energy path, U.S. fossil fuel spending is likely to grow, totaling an estimated $23 trillion between 2010 and 2030.

Policymakers in Washington, D.C., and many states have recently taken the first small steps toward a clean energy future, adopting policies to encourage energy efficiency, ramp up the use of solar and wind power, and curb global warming pollution. Now, with even bolder steps – such as a national cap on global warming pollution and more ambitious targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency – on the public agenda, powerful interests with a stake in preserving the status quo have criticized strong clean energy policies as being too expensive for the American public.

In fact, the reverse is true. The United States cannot afford to wait to break our dependence on fossil fuels. The cost of fossil fuels to our economy and our environment will continue to mount in the years to come unless the nation takes bold steps now to embrace the benefits of a clean energy future.

America is overly reliant on fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas and oil. This dependence is costly to everyday citizens, and sends valuable dollars overseas and out of the domestic economy.

The United States depends on fossil fuels for 85 percent of our energy supply.
In 2006, American consumers and businesses spent $921 billion – or close to 7 percent of America’s gross domestic product – on fossil fuels, more than the nation spent on education or the military. In 2008, national expenditures on fossil fuels likely topped $1 trillion for the first time ever. Each year, more than 70 percent of this money is spent on oil.
In 2007, America spent more than $360 billion importing fossil fuels, with the vast majority of that money spent on crude oil. That money is a direct transfer of wealth from American consumers to oil companies and foreign governments.
For every dollar that an American household spends each year, about 10 cents is likely to go toward the purchase of energy, with most of that money spent on fossil fuels.
Fossil fuel production and use damage our environment and our health – inflicting even greater damage on the American economy and our quality of life.

Fossil fuel combustion is the leading contributor to global warming, which, in addition to being a looming environmental and human catastrophe, could inflict massive economic damage as well:

Sea level rise and an increase in the severity of storms could put key cities such as New York, Miami and New Orleans at greater risk of costly storm damage. A 2008 Natural Resources Defense Council study estimated that high-intensity hurricanes could cause as much as $422 billion in damages in Atlantic and Gulf Coast states between 2025 and 2100.
A 2007 study by researchers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Carnegie Institution at Stanford University found that global production of three of the six largest global crops experienced significant losses due to global warming between 1981 and 2002. The study concluded that global wheat growers, for example, lost $2.6 billion and global corn growers lost $1.2 billion in 2002.
Global warming is forecast to inflict a variety of other costs, including declining rainfalls and rising temperatures that will combine to cause large and extended drought conditions in regions like the Southwest, and impacts on public health due to heat-related illnesses, greater formation of ozone smog, and increases in vector-borne disease.
An assessment by former World Bank Chief Economist Sir Nicholas Stern indicates that global warming has the potential to reduce global per-capita consumption by as much as 20 percent.
Fossil fuel production and use also imposes other environmental and social costs besides those related to global warming.

Fossil fuels are a leading source of air and water pollution. The economic cost of air pollution in sectors regulated under the Clean Air Act has been estimated at $9 trillion between 1970 and 2000, with costs resulting from pollution-induced early mortality, illness, health care costs and lost productivity.
The production and transport of fossil fuels results in routine pollution of the environment and occasional catastrophic accidents. The December 2008 collapse of a coal ash pond outside a Tennessee Valley Authority power plant covered 300 acres in sludge and will cost an estimated $825 million to clean up. Between 1990 and 2006, 51 large oil spills in the United States resulted in the expenditure of between $860 million and $1.1 billion in removal costs and compensation for damages.
The economic and environmental burden of fossil fuel dependence will only worsen in the years to come.

The United States will spend an estimated $23 trillion on fossil fuels between 2010 and 2030 should energy consumption and fossil fuel prices follow U.S. government projections – an amount equivalent to three years’ worth of income for the entire American workforce at current earning rates.
Fossil fuel expenditures will decline in the next several years due to the lingering effects of the economic recession, but annual expenditures of more than $1 trillion per year – which proved devastating to the economy during early 2008 – will become the “new normal” by the middle of the next decade. By 2030, the United States can expect to spend approximately $360 billion more per year on fossil fuels than we did in 2006.
If fossil fuel prices are driven higher, faster, the United States could expect to spend more than $30 trillion on fossil fuels between 2010 and 2030. Fossil fuel expenditures would again surpass $1 trillion in 2011 and by 2030 we will be spending $750 billion more per year on fossil fuels than the nation did in 2006.
Oil prices are a main driver of higher expenditures. If oil prices reach $200 per barrel by 2030 – an event more likely to happen as world oil supplies become increasingly strained – the United States will be spending $1.3 trillion out of $1.6 trillion total fossil fuel costs on oil alone.
Rising fossil fuel expenditures will affect all 50 states, but states with a greater reliance on fossil fuels, particularly oil, will experience greater increases. (See Appendix A for projected fossil fuel expenditures for all 50 states.)
Investing in clean energy that never runs out can reap economic savings. The United States has the ability today to produce this energy, and to help Americans use energy more efficiently in their homes, businesses and vehicles.

A 2007 analysis by McKinsey & Company estimated that the United States could reduce its emissions of global warming pollution by approximately 1.2 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year (equal to about 20 percent of today’s fossil fuel emissions) with net dollars savings. In other words, these investments are economic winners on their own terms – even excluding benefits for the environment, public health and America’s security.
A recent Energy Information Administration analysis of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) found that the Act’s provisions for residential and commercial energy efficiency improvements will yield significant savings. The EIA projects that the law will reduce residential and commercial energy bills by $13 billion in 2020 and $21 billion in 2030.
The recent move by President Obama to increase federal vehicle fuel economy standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2016 will deliver $20 billion in net savings to consumers in 2020 at gasoline prices of $2.25 per gallon. If gasoline prices hit $4 per gallon, the net benefits would balloon to $70 billion.
According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, transitioning to a clean energy economy could cut global warming emissions while saving consumers and businesses $465 billion each year by 2030, with $1.7 trillion in net cumulative savings between 2010 and 2030.
The federal government, along with the states, should take actions to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. They should:

Reduce the nation’s emissions of global warming pollutants deeply enough to prevent dangerous impacts from global warming, guided by the latest scientific understanding. The United States should adopt an emissions cap and other policies that will reduce global warming pollution by 35 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and by 80 percent below 2005 levels by 2050, and implement strict rules for carbon “offsets” to ensure that efforts to reduce emissions are successful.
Ensure that a cap-and-trade program used to achieve those targets directs the revenues gained through the sale of allowances for public purposes. One hundred percent of emission allowances should be auctioned, with the revenues used for investments in clean energy and to benefit consumers.
Ensure that America generates at least 25 percent of its electricity from renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar power by 2025.
Strengthen energy efficiency standards and codes for appliances and buildings, with the goal of reducing energy consumption in new buildings by 50 percent by 2020 and ensuring that all new buildings use zero net energy by 2030.
Promote the development and implementation of clean transportation infrastructure, including improving the fuel economy of light- and heavy-duty vehicles, reducing the carbon intensity of transportation fuels, and promoting plug-in vehicles, public transportation and high-speed intercity rail.
Ramp up investment in solar power through tax credits, specific targets in state renewable electricity standards, requirements for “solar ready homes,” rebate programs, and other measures.
End subsidies to fossil fuel industries."
"Background
Previous research suggests that providing generalized information about the health implications of air pollution from fossil fuels may be effective at promoting public support for a transition to cleaner sources of energy. We sought to extend that work by identifying the specific messages about the health implications of air pollution from fossil fuels that are most and least concerning to people, and whether rankings of concern vary among different audiences. We also hypothesized that reading the statements would influence people’s attitudes and behavioral intentions in a manner supportive of a transition to cleaner sources of energy.

Methods
We conducted a survey with a diverse sample of U.S. adults (n?=?1644) from a non-probability internet panel. Using maximum difference scaling, participants ranked a set of ten statements that revealed which statements were the most and least concerning to them. We also measured attitudes about air pollution and energy use before and after the ranking exercise to assess changes in opinion caused by cumulative exposure to the messages.

Results
Across all sub-groups examined, participants were most concerned by a message about the neurological impacts of air pollution on babies and children. After the ranking exercise, participants expressed increases in perceived health harm of air pollution and fossil fuels, a desire for more clean energy, and intention to engage in consumer advocacy to support clean energy.

Conclusions
To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess how people respond to information about the neurological health harms of air pollution from fossil fuels. While efforts to communicate the cardio-pulmonary health harms of air pollution are well established, our study suggests that efforts should now be organized to communicate the neurological effects of air pollution from fossil fuels, especially the neuro-developmental effects on babies and children.

Peer Review reports
Background
Modern civilization’s reliance on fossil fuels has created enormous economic progress over the past century, but it has also exacted a terrible public health toll [1,2,3]. Experts have long understood that air pollution from fossil fuels leads to cardio-pulmonary health harms [4], and scientists are increasingly documenting a wide array of significant health impacts associated with climate change largely driven by the use of fossil fuels [2]. More recently, neurological health harms associated with fossil fuel use are just now coming to be substantiated in the research literature [5,6,7,8]. A wide array of evidence suggests a transition to a clean energy economy would dramatically improve public health [1, 3, 9,10,11,12]. Therefore, a pressing question becomes: What is the best way to build public support for a clean energy economy? A modestly sized research literature already exists on how to communicate the cardio-pulmonary health impacts of air pollution, and there is a small but emerging research literature on communicating the health impacts of climate change. What does not yet exist at all is research examining how to communicate the neurological impacts of fossil fuels. Filling that gap is the focus of the current study.

A recent review suggests that informing people about the health implications of climate change can strengthen efforts to increase personal involvement with the issue [13]. For example, some studies have shown that a focus on the negative health effects of climate change can increase cognitive and affective engagement with the issue across political spectrum, especially among moderates and those who lean conservative [14, 15].

A separate, but related strategy is to focus on the more direct health effects of air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels as a way to increase public desire for a transition to cleaner sources of energy. Although studies in this area have primarily only tested generalized information about the health effects of fossil fuels or information about cardio-pulmonary harms, this approach shows promise for several reasons. Surveys consistently show that Americans report more concern about local air pollution than climate change [16]. People also tend to view the health effects of air pollution as closer in time and space, and more personally threatening relative to climate change [17].

Providing people with information about the health effects of air pollution from fossil fuels also seems to be effective at increasing support for clean energy policies and promoting conservation behaviors. For example, one experiment found that providing information about air pollution from fossil fuels is more effective at decreasing support for fossil fuel use and increasing support for low-carbon energy sources like solar, wind, and nuclear than information about climate change [16]. A recent field experiment found that providing parents of young children with information about the health effects of air pollution led them to have less favorable attitudes toward fossil fuels [18].

Several studies have found that focusing on the negative health effects of fossil fuels and justifying mitigation policies in terms of their health benefits was more effective at garnering support among Republicans than justifying them based upon their potential to reduce climate change [19,20,21]. Similarly, providing information about how pollution from coal power plants leads to premature deaths can increase support for the U.S. federal Production Tax Credit, a policy designed to promote the development of renewable energy [22]. Lastly, two field experiments have shown that information about the public health externalities of fossil fuel use, such as impacts on childhood asthma and cancer, is more effective at promoting household energy conservation than information about environmental externalities or personal cost savings associated with reduced electricity use [23, 24].

From a public health perspective, these previous studies suggest that informing people about the negative health effects of air pollution caused by fossil fuels is likely to be a useful way to increase public involvement in decisions about how best to manage those health risks. Yet, it remains unclear what specific kinds of risk information about air pollution are most engaging to people. Helping audiences understand both the severity of a threat and their susceptibility to it are two key ways to help motivate protective action [25]. Previous research suggests that public awareness of specific health problems caused by air pollution is limited, with people most commonly connecting it to asthma and other respiratory conditions, but few other specific health outcomes [26, 27]. While the contribution of air pollution to respiratory disease is well-established [4], a growing body of evidence suggests that air pollution contributes to a range of serious neurological disorders, including neurodevelopmental impacts in children and neurodegenerative effects in older adults [5,6,7,8]. Hence, a key goal of the current study was to ascertain how novel information about neurological impacts from air pollution caused by fossil fuels—and who is most vulnerable to those neurological impacts—would impact people’s attitudes toward energy use.

In the present study, we build upon previous research in two key ways. First, we sought to identify which specific messages about the health effects of air pollution from fossil fuels were the most concerning to Americans by surveying a demographically diverse group of people recruited through an online non-probability panel and asking them to rank a series of ten statements that included 1) general information about the fact that air pollution harms human health, 2) specific information about well-established health harms from air pollution caused by fossil fuels (such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases), 3) specific information about emerging health harms from air pollution (including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative impacts), 4) information about which populations are the most vulnerable to health harms from air pollution (children, older adults, and low-income populations), and 5) the mechanisms by which air pollution harms human health.

In addition to identifying the most concerning messages overall, we assessed whether statement rankings differ among certain subgroups. Dual-process models of message processing stress the importance of personal relevance in shaping responses to message content [28, 29]. Because some of the statements we tested focus on the specific vulnerabilities of older adults, children, and low income populations, we suspected that members and caretakers of these groups might rank the statements differently than the general population. Additionally, political identification tends to have a major influence on attitudes toward the environment in the United States [30,31,32], and recent studies suggest a focus on the health effects of air pollution may be especially engaging among Republicans [19, 20]. Hence, we wanted to explore whether the messages were ranked differently among Republicans, Independents, and Democrats. This leads us to our first two research questions:

RQ1: Which health implications of air pollution from fossil fuel use are most concerning to members of the public?

RQ2: Do rankings of concern about the health implications of air pollution from fossil fuel use vary among different sub-groups of the public?

Beyond identifying the most concerning statements about air pollution from fossil fuels, we sought to determine whether exposure to information about the health implications of air pollution from fossil fuel use led to changes in people’s attitudes toward air pollution, fossil fuels, and clean energy. To do this, we assessed the cumulative impact of reading the ten statements by measuring participants’ attitudes both before and after the ranking task. We view this part of our study through the lens of the expectancy-value model of attitude formation, which posits that attitudes are a function of the weighted sum of evaluative beliefs held by an individual about a given object [33]. For example, one’s attitude toward fossil fuels might be based on the negative belief that they cause harm to the environment and the positive belief that are relatively inexpensive compared to other sources of energy. Depending on the relative importance that people place on harm to the environment versus economic costs, their attitude toward fossil fuels may be positive, negative, or neutral. As a result, persuasive appeals may shift people’s attitudes either by providing new considerations that expand or change the set of salient beliefs that form an attitude, or by changing the relative importance that individuals place on existing attitude-relevant beliefs. We suspect that the information about the neurological health effects of air pollution from fossil fuels will be novel and important to most individuals, adding new considerations that will influence their attitudes toward air pollution, fossil fuels, and clean energy. Because more negative attitudes may also lead people to take protective actions to reduce the threat from air pollution caused by fossil fuels [25, 34], we also assessed whether the statements increased people’s intentions to engage in consumer and political advocacy to support the use of clean energy. Given that previous studies have found messages about the health effects of air pollution to be especially persuasive among Republicans [19, 20], we were also interested to know whether changes in attitudes and behavioral intentions after the message-ranking task would be moderated by party affiliation. In particular, this partisan difference may be driven by “ceiling effects” among Democrats, such that they are already highly supportive of clean energy and thus less responsive to new information about air pollution from fossil fuels [19]. Therefore, we tested the following two hypotheses, the first of which we consider to be exploratory:

H1: Exposure to information about the health implications of air pollution caused by fossil fuels will enhance engagement in a variety of ways that favor accelerating the transition from a fossil fuel economy to a clean energy economy, including: increasing risk perceptions associated with (a) air pollution, and (b) fossil fuels; (c) increasing support for clean energy use, and (d) reducing support for fossil fuel energy use; (e) increasing opposition to fossil fuel plants near one’s home; (f) increasing support for government and industry leadership on clean energy use; and (g) increasing intention to engage in political advocacy in support of clean energy, and (h) increasing intention to engage in consumer advocacy in support of clean energy.

H2: The influence of exposure to information about the health implications of air pollution caused by fossil fuels will be moderated by party affiliation such that Republicans will demonstrate more changes in attitudes and behavioral intentions than Democrats.

Methods
Sample
Recruitment was conducted in December 2017 by Qualtrics, a vendor that maintains a nationwide non-probability panel of individuals who have agreed to participate in online surveys (for more information about Qualtrics, see: https://www.qualtrics.com/). Participants were a demographically diverse group of American adults (total n?=?1644). Out of the total sample, 1025 individuals were balanced on gender, age, education, income, Hispanic ethnicity, and race to approximate the general U.S. population. The remaining 619 participants were composed of an oversample of roughly 100 additional individuals from each of the following six target groups: African American women, Hispanic women, mothers of young children, expectant mothers, childcare providers/preschool teachers, and healthcare professionals. We intentionally oversampled these groups to understand whether message rankings differed according to these individuals because they represent members and caretakers of populations that are particularly vulnerable to the health effects air pollution from fossil fuels [8, 35, 36]. Demographic characteristics of the total sample can be found in Table S1 of Additional file 1.

Protocol
After agreeing to participate in the study, participants were asked a number of demographic questions. These questions were included at the beginning of the survey so that we could identify whether their response would fulfill outstanding demographic quotas without forcing participants to fill out the complete survey. This section was followed by questions to measure participants’ attitudes toward air pollution, fossil fuels, and clean energy, and their behavioral intentions regarding consumer and political advocacy (see below). Next, participants engaged in a maximum difference scaling exercise to elicit their ranking of ten different statements about fossil fuels and health. These ten statements were designed to present a broad range of factual information about the health consequences of air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels, including statements about well-established health harms such as asthma, cancer, and heart disease; emerging neurological health harms to children; emerging neurological health harms to older adults; mechanisms by which air pollution causes harm to health; and statements about who is most likely to be harmed by air pollution from fossil fuels (see Table 1 for exact wording of the statements). Creation of the ten statements was informed by respondent feedback from a separate study we conducted, consisting of in-depth interviews with 32 individuals. Participants in that study were provided a one-page statement about air pollution, fossil fuels, and health and then asked to answer a number of questions about their reaction to the information in the document. It is important to note that these ten statements are evidence-based, and were reviewed before use by experts on the health impacts of air pollution caused by fossil fuel use. A science synthesis document from which the statements were derived can be found here: https://bit.ly/2MTtGjO.

Table 1 Statement rankings including subgroup analysis of members and caretakers of vulnerable populations
Full size table
Maximum difference scaling — or MaxDiff — is a methodology that allows researchers to determine the relative preferences of respondents for a series of items [37,38,39]. For this study, we applied the MaxDiff technique to evaluate a series of ten statements to identify the ones that cause the most and least concern. The ten statements were shown to each respondent multiple times across eight screens, with each screen displaying a different combination of four statements. Each statement was displayed on average three times. On each screen, respondents were asked to select the statement that causes them the most concern and the one that causes them the least concern (see Additional file 1 for exact question wording). These two selections provide five data points per screen on a respondent’s preferences about the four statements displayed. For example, if statements A, B, C, and D are shown, and a respondent selects A as the greatest concern and D as the least concern, we learn that: A?>?B; A?>?C; A?>?D; B?>?D; C?>?D.

Through a hierarchical Bayes estimation method developed by Sawtooth Software, these data points — 40 per respondent from the eight screens — allow for the calculation of individual respondent-level utility scores for each of the items tested. The total study has 65,760 data points for the MaxDiff exercise (1644 survey interviews ×?40 data points), which provide a high level of precision and confidence in the aggregated utility scores.

MaxDiff message evaluation offers distinct advantages over traditional methodologies using a Likert or numbered rating scale. The main advantage is that as a forced-choice exercise, respondents cannot rate all of the messages equally positive (or equally negative). In order to proceed through the survey they must pick and choose between the different options. The resulting data are highly differentiated and more clearly show strong and weak messages. Also, because there is no rating scale involved, MaxDiff eliminates scale-use bias, where different respondents use the same rating scale differently. For example, one respondent may only provide answers between 8 and 10 on a 0–10 scale while another respondent only provides answers between 7 and 9, despite both respondents holding similar views.

In addition to calculating the utility scores for each message, we also conducted a Total Unduplicated Reach Frequency analysis — or simply “reach analysis” — to identify the combination of messages that, taken together, are most highly concerning to the largest portion of respondents [40]. While the utility scores tell us the relative ranking of the messages for all respondents, a statement’s “reach” equals the percentage of respondents ranking that item as their greatest or second greatest concern. The “reach” for any two statements equals the percentage of respondents ranking either statement as their greatest or second greatest concern. Our analysis examines the total reach for every possible combination of statements and determines the package that causes the most concern.

The reach analysis provides guidance on the unique, unduplicated effect of each statement. Such an analysis would typically look for the combination of statements that greatly concerns 80% or more of the target audience, usually 3–5 statements.

After completing the MaxDiff exercise, participants were again asked the same attitude and behavioral intention questions. Lastly, participants were asked questions about their political orientation.

To examine the cumulative effect of reading and ranking the statements on participants’ attitudes and behavioral intentions, we conducted a series of mixed-design ANOVAs (analysis of variance) with time (T1- pre-test vs. T2- post-test) as a within-subjects factor and party affiliation as a between-subjects factor. A Bonferroni adjustment was used for all pairwise comparisons.

Effect size estimates for specific contrasts are provided in terms of Cohen’s d [41]. The effect size descriptors—small, medium, and large—are specific to communication research, and were derived from a quantitative review of meta-analyses [42]. A small effect refers to a Cohen’s d value of less than .20, a medium effect refers to values of d between .20 and .50, and a large effect refers to values of d greater than .50 [42]. A power analysis conducted with G*Power 3.1 revealed that our sample size (n?=?1644) gave us enough power to detect a small effect size for the main effect of the within-subjects factor (d?=?0.070) and the interaction of the within-subjects factor with partisanship (d?=?.086), assuming ??=?.05, ??=?.80 [43].

Dependent variables
Perceived health risk of air pollution
Perceived risk of air pollution was measured with a single 6-point item that asked people to indicate how much of a risk they feel air pollution poses to the health of their family members. (1?=?No risk at all; 2?=?Very small risk; 3?=?Small risk; 4?=?Medium risk; 5?=?Large risk; 6?=?Very large risk). The question also included a “Don’t know” response option which was treated as missing data in analysis. This measure was adapted from one used in previous research [44].

Perceived harm from fossil fuels was the average of three 5-point items that asked respondents to rate the following sources of energy in terms of how harmful they are to people’s health: coal; oil; and natural gas. The list of different energy sources assessed in the survey question also included solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal. All the energy sources were presented in random order to prevent order effects. (1?=?Not at all harmful; 2?=?A little harmful; 3?=?Moderately harmful; 4?=?Very harmful; 5?=?Extremely harmful). The items also included a “Don’t know” response option which was treated as missing data in analysis. Cronbach’s  ?T1?=?.73; ?T2?=?.76. This measure was adapted from one used in previous research [16, 44, 45].

The list of different energy sources assessed in the survey question also included solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal. All the energy sources were presented in random order to prevent order effects. (1?=?Much less; 2?=?Somewhat less; 3?=?A little less; 4?=?About the same; 5?=?A little more; 6?=?Somewhat more; 7?=?Much more). Cronbach’s ?T1?=?.77; ?T2?=?.81.

Support for a new fossil fuel power plant near one’s home (a measure of “not in my back yard” or NIMBY attitude) was the average of three 7-point items that asked participants whether they would support or oppose a new power plant being built within 25?miles of their home that uses the following sources of energy: coal; oil; and natural gas. The list of different energy sources assessed in the survey question also included solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal. All the energy sources were presented in random order to prevent order effects. (1?=?Strongly oppose; 2?=?Moderately oppose; 3?=?Slightly oppose; 4?=?Neither support nor oppose; 5?=?Slightly support; 6?=?Moderately support; 7?=?Strongly support). Cronbach’s ?T1?=?.82; ?T2?=?.83.

Support for government and industry leadership on clean energy
Support for government and industry leadership on clean energy was the average of seven 7-point items that asked whether the following should be doing more, less, or about the same amount as they are doing now to support the use of clean energy: The President; the U.S. Congress; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; the U.S. Department of Energy; your state government; your local government; and corporations and industry. All entities were presented in random order to prevent order effects. (1?=?Much less; 2?=?Somewhat less; 3?=?A little less; 4?=?About the same; 5?=?A little more; 6?=?Somewhat more; 7?=?Much more). Cronbach’s ?T1?=?.96; ?T2?=?.96. This measure was adapted from one used in previous research to assess support for government and industry leadership on climate change [14, 46].

Consumer advocacy intentions
Consumer advocacy intentions were the average of three 5-point items that asked how likely they are to engage in the following actions over the next 12?months to support clean energy: contact corporate officials to urge them to support the use of clean energy; contact your local electrical utility to urge them to support the use of more clean energy; purchase clean energy from your local utility. (1?=?Not at all likely; 2?=?Slightly likely; 3?=?Moderately likely; 4?=?Very likely; 5?=?Extremely likely). Cronbach’s ?T1?=?.85; ?T2?=?.87.

Political advocacy intentions
Political advocacy intentions were the average of three 5-point items that asked how likely they are to engage in the following actions over the next 12?months to support clean energy: contact government officials to urge them to support the use of clean energy; join an organization working to support the use of more clean energy; vote for a political candidate because they support the use of more clean energy. (1?=?Not at all likely; 2?=?Slightly likely; 3?=?Moderately likely; 4?=?Very likely; 5?=?Extremely likely). Cronbach’s ?T1?=?.82; ?T2?=?.84. This measure was adapted from one used in previous research to assess political advocacy intentions about global warming [46].

Moderator variable

Party affiliation was measured with a single 7-point item that asked participants whether they think of themselves as a 1?=?strong Democrat, 2?=?Democrat, 3?=?Independent, but lean Democrat, 4?=?Independent, 5?=?Independent, but lean Republication, 6?=?Republican, 7?=?Strong Republican.

Results
Statement rankings
Contrary to expectation, there was a high level of agreement among all sub-groups analyzed regarding which statements were most concerning to them. The total population sampled, as well as each sub-group isolated in the analysis (Table 1: older adults, low income, mothers of young children, expectant mothers, childcare providers, and healthcare professionals; Table 2: Democrats, Independents, Republicans) identified the same three statements as being of greatest concern. Most concerning was a statement about a range of specific neurological health problems that air pollution can cause in babies and young children. Second most concerning was a statement about the potential for air pollution to cause permanent damage to the brains of children and older adults. Third most concerning was a general statement about harm to the brains of children—including babies before birth—that makes it more difficult for them to learn and thrive.

Table 2 Statement rankings including subgroup analysis of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans
Full size table
There were also high levels of agreement among all sub-groups regarding the three least concerning statements. The least concerning statement called attention to and explained why low-income populations are particularly vulnerable to air pollution. Second least concerning was a more general statement that invoked the “serious—sometimes life-long—health problems for many Americans” caused by air pollution. The third least concerning statement focused solely on older adults, even though it mentioned air pollution “contributing to dementia and possibly Alzheimer’s Disease” which we assumed would be conditions of grave concern to many people.

The statements ranked in the middle included a statement about the vulnerability of multiple groups (low-income populations, older adults, and children), two statements about the mechanisms by which air pollution causes health problems (one of which focused on specific toxic chemicals in air pollution, and the other focused on explaining why the “tiny particles” in air pollution are so harmful), and a statement about well-established health problems caused by air pollution (e.g., heart disease, asthma, and lung cancer).

Reach analysis
We conducted a reach analysis to identify which four statements were ranked as the first or second most concerning by the largest number of respondents, in this case, 84%. The overall most highly ranked statement (which outlined the specific neurological health problems that air pollution can cause in children) was ranked as first or second most concerning by 40% of respondents (#1 by preference score). Next, the message that outlined some of the well-established health problems caused by air pollution was ranked as first or second most concerning by 18% of participants (#6 by preference score). The statement that emphasized the vulnerability of older adults and children to the long-lasting neurological effects of air pollution was ranked as first or second most concerning to 16% of respondents (#2 by preference score). Lastly, the message that identified the specific toxic chemicals released by burning fossil fuels that can cause neurological harm to people was ranked first or second most concerning by 10% of participants (#4 by preference score).

Cumulative message effects
Engaging in the message-ranking exercise led to substantial (i.e., medium-sized effects) increases in participants’ perceived risk of air pollution and fossil fuels (see Table 3). Additionally, participants became less supportive of fossil fuel energy use in the United States, and more opposed to a new fossil fuel power plant being built near their home. Participants also became more likely to support clean energy use in the United States and became more supportive of government and industry efforts to embrace clean energy. Participants also became more likely to express an intention to engage in consumer advocacy, although not more likely to intend to engage in political advocacy. Taken together, these findings support our first hypothesis, with the exception of increased intention to engage in political advocacy. However, we did not find support for our second hypothesis. None of the effects of the statement-ranking exercise were moderated by partisan orientation (see Additional file 1: Tables S2-S9)."
"Greenhouse gases affect Earth’s energy balance and climate
The Sun serves as the primary energy source for Earth’s climate. Some of the incoming sunlight is reflected directly back into space, especially by bright surfaces such as ice and clouds, and the rest is absorbed by the surface and the atmosphere. Much of this absorbed solar energy is re-emitted as heat (longwave or infrared radiation). The atmosphere in turn absorbs and re-radiates heat, some of which escapes to space. Any disturbance to this balance of incoming and outgoing energy will affect the climate. For example, small changes in the output of energy from the Sun will affect this balance directly.

If all heat energy emitted from the surface passed through the atmosphere directly into space, Earth’s average surface temperature would be tens of degrees colder than today. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, act to make the surface much warmer than this because they absorb and emit heat energy in all directions (including downwards), keeping Earth’s surface and lower atmosphere warm [Figure B1]. Without this greenhouse effect, life as we know it could not have evolved on our planet. Adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere makes it even more effective at preventing heat from escaping into space. When the energy leaving is less than the energy entering, Earth warms until a new balance is established.

Greenhouse gases emitted by human activities alter Earth’s energy balance and thus its climate. Humans also affect climate by changing the nature of the land surfaces (for example by clearing forests for farming) and through the emission of pollutants that affect the amount and type of particles in the atmosphere.

Scientists have determined that, when all human and natural factors are considered, Earth’s climate balance has been altered towards warming, with the biggest contributor being increases in CO2.

The measurements are made at remote places like these because they are not greatly influenced by local processes, so therefore they are representative of the background atmosphere. The small up-and-down saw-tooth pattern reflects seasonal changes in the release and uptake of CO2 by plants.Source: Scripps CO2 Program (larger version)
Human activities have added greenhouse gases to the atmosphere
The atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased significantly since the Industrial Revolution began. In the case of carbon dioxide, the average concentration measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii has risen from 316 parts per million (ppm) in 1959 (the first full year of data available) to more than 411 ppm in 2019 [Figure B2]. The same rates of increase have since been recorded at numerous other stations worldwide. Since preindustrial times, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased by over 40%, methane has increased by more than 150%, and nitrous oxide has increased by roughly 20%. More than half of the increase in CO2 has occurred since 1970. Increases in all three gases contribute to warming of Earth, with the increase in CO2 playing the largest role.

Scientists have examined greenhouse gases in the context of the past. Analysis of air trapped inside ice that has been accumulating over time in Antarctica shows that the CO2 concentration began to increase significantly in the 19th century [Figure B3], after staying in the range of 260 to 280 ppm for the previous 10,000 years. Ice core records extending back 800,000 years show that during that time, CO2 concentrations remained within the range of 170 to 300 ppm throughout many “ice age” cycles - learn about the ice ages -  and no concentration above 300 ppm is seen in ice core records until the past 200 years.

Measurements of the forms (isotopes) of carbon in the modern atmosphere show a clear fingerprint of the addition of “old” carbon (depleted in natural radioactive 14C) coming from the combustion of fossil fuels (as opposed to “newer” carbon coming from living systems). In addition, it is known that human activities (excluding land use changes) currently emit an estimated 10 billion tonnes of carbon each year, mostly by burning fossil fuels, which is more than enough to explain the observed increase in concentration. These and other lines of evidence point conclusively to the fact that the elevated CO2 concentration in our atmosphere is the result of human activities.

Climate records show a warming trend
Estimating global average surface air temperature increase requires careful analysis of millions of measurements from around the world, including from land stations, ships, and satellites. Despite the many complications of synthesising such data, multiple independent teams have concluded separately and unanimously that global average surface air temperature has risen by about 1 °C (1.8 °F) since 1900 [Figure B4]. Although the record shows several pauses and accelerations in the increasing trend, each of the last four decades has been warmer than any other decade in the instrumental record since 1850.

Going further back in time before accurate thermometers were widely available, temperatures can be reconstructed using climate-sensitive indicators “proxies” in materials such as tree rings, ice cores, and marine sediments. Comparisons of the thermometer record with these proxy measurements suggest that the time since the early 1980s has been the warmest 40-year period in at least eight centuries, and that global temperature is rising towards peak temperatures last seen 5,000 to 10,000 years ago in the warmest part of our current interglacial period.

Many other impacts associated with the warming trend have become evident in recent years. Arctic summer sea ice cover has shrunk dramatically. The heat content of the ocean has increased. Global average sea level has risen by approximately 16 cm (6 inches) since 1901, due both to the expansion of warmer ocean water and to the addition of melt waters from glaciers and ice sheets on land. Warming and precipitation changes are altering the geographical ranges of many plant and animal species and the timing of their life cycles. In addition to the effects on climate, some of the excess CO2 in the atmosphere is being taken up by the ocean, changing its chemical composition (causing ocean acidification).

Many complex processes shape our climate
Based just on the physics of the amount of energy that CO2 absorbs and emits, a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration from pre-industrial levels (up to about 560 ppm) would by itself cause a global average temperature increase of about 1 °C (1.8 °F). In the overall climate system, however, things are more complex; warming leads to further effects (feedbacks) that either amplify or diminish the initial warming.

The most important feedbacks involve various forms of water. A warmer atmosphere generally contains more water vapour. Water vapour is a potent greenhouse gas, thus causing more warming; its short lifetime in the atmosphere keeps its increase largely in step with warming. Thus, water vapour is treated as an amplifier, and not a driver, of climate change. Higher temperatures in the polar regions melt sea ice and reduce seasonal snow cover, exposing a darker ocean and land surface that can absorb more heat, causing further warming. Another important but uncertain feedback concerns changes in clouds. Warming and increases in water vapour together may cause cloud cover to increase or decrease which can either amplify or dampen temperature change depending on the changes in the horizontal extent, altitude, and properties of clouds. The latest assessment of the science indicates that the overall net global effect of cloud changes is likely to be to amplify warming.

The ocean moderates climate change. The ocean is a huge heat reservoir, but it is difficult to heat its full depth because warm water tends to stay near the surface. The rate at which heat is transferred to the deep ocean is therefore slow; it varies from year to year and from decade to decade, and it helps to determine the pace of warming at the surface. Observations of the sub-surface ocean are limited prior to about 1970, but since then, warming of the upper 700 m (2,300 feet) is readily apparent, and deeper warming is also clearly observed since about 1990.

Surface temperatures and rainfall in most regions vary greatly from the global average because of geographical location, in particular latitude and continental position. Both the average values of temperature, rainfall, and their extremes (which generally have the largest impacts on natural systems and human infrastructure), are also strongly affected by local patterns of winds.

Estimating the effects of feedback processes, the pace of the warming, and regional climate change requires the use of mathematical models of the atmosphere, ocean, land, and ice (the cryosphere) built upon established laws of physics and the latest understanding of the physical, chemical and biological processes affecting climate, and run on powerful computers. Models vary in their projections of how much additional warming to expect (depending on the type of model and on assumptions used in simulating certain climate processes, particularly cloud formation and ocean mixing), but all such models agree that the overall net effect of feedbacks is to amplify warming.

Human activities are changing the climate
Rigorous analysis of all data and lines of evidence shows that most of the observed global warming over the past 50 years or so cannot be explained by natural causes and instead requires a significant role for the influence of human activities.

In order to discern the human influence on climate, scientists must consider many natural variations that affect temperature, precipitation, and other aspects of climate from local to global scale, on timescales from days to decades and longer. One natural variation is the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), an irregular alternation between warming and cooling (lasting about two to seven years) in the equatorial Pacific Ocean that causes significant year-to-year regional and global shifts in temperature and rainfall patterns. Volcanic eruptions also alter climate, in part increasing the amount of small (aerosol) particles in the stratosphere that reflect or absorb sunlight, leading to a short-term surface cooling lasting typically about two to three years. Over hundreds of thousands of years, slow, recurring variations in Earth’s orbit around the Sun, which alter the distribution of solar energy received by Earth, have been enough to trigger the ice age cycles of the past 800,000 years.

Fingerprinting is a powerful way of studying the causes of climate change. Different influences on climate lead to different patterns seen in climate records. This becomes obvious when scientists probe beyond changes in the average temperature of the planet and look more closely at geographical and temporal patterns of climate change. For example, an increase in the Sun’s energy output will lead to a very different pattern of temperature change (across Earth’s surface and vertically in the atmosphere) compared to that induced by an increase in CO2 concentration. Observed atmospheric temperature changes show a fingerprint much closer to that of a long-term CO2 increase than to that of a fluctuating Sun alone. Scientists routinely test whether purely natural changes in the Sun, volcanic activity, or internal climate variability could plausibly explain the patterns of change they have observed in many different aspects of the climate system. These analyses have shown that the observed climate changes of the past several decades cannot be explained just by natural factors.

How will climate change in the future?
Scientists have made major advances in the observations, theory, and modelling of Earth’s climate system, and these advances have enabled them to project future climate change with increasing confidence. Nevertheless, several major issues make it impossible to give precise estimates of how global or regional temperature trends will evolve decade by decade into the future. Firstly, we cannot predict how much CO2 human activities will emit, as this depends on factors such as how the global economy develops and how society’s production and consumption of energy changes in the coming decades. Secondly, with current understanding of the complexities of how climate feedbacks operate, there is a range of possible outcomes, even for a particular scenario of CO2 emissions. Finally, over timescales of a decade or so, natural variability can modulate the effects of an underlying trend in temperature. Taken together, all model projections indicate that Earth will continue to warm considerably more over the next few decades to centuries. If there were no technological or policy changes to reduce emission trends from their current trajectory, then further globally-averaged warming of 2.6 to 4.8 °C (4.7 to 8.6 °F) in addition to that which has already occurred would be expected during the 21st century [Figure B5]. Projecting what those ranges will mean for the climate experienced at any particular location is a challenging scientific problem, but estimates are continuing to improve as regional and local-scale models advance."
"Five years after the adoption of the Paris Climate Agreement, growth in global CO2 emissions has begun to falter. The pervasive disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic have radically altered the trajectory of global CO2 emissions. Contradictory effects of the post-COVID-19 investments in fossil fuel-based infrastructure and the recent strengthening of climate targets must be addressed with new policy choices to sustain a decline in global emissions in the post-COVID-19 era.

Main
Global fossil CO2 emissions have decreased by around 2.6?GtCO2 in 2020 to 34?GtCO2 (Fig. 1). This projected decrease, caused largely by the measures implemented to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, is about 7% below 2019 levels, according to the analysis of the Global Carbon Project1 on the basis of multiple studies2,3,4 and recent monthly energy data. A 2.6?GtCO2 decrease in global annual emissions has never been observed before. Yet cuts of 1–2?GtCO2 per year are needed throughout the 2020s and beyond to avoid exceeding warming levels in the range 1.5?°C to well below 2?°C, the ambition of the Paris Agreement5. The drop in CO2 emissions from responses to COVID-19 highlights the scale of actions and international adherence needed to tackle climate change.

The 2020 decrease in emissions masks complex dynamics and differences in countries’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic over time. In most countries, emissions decreased at the peak of the country’s confinement, by on average 27% on the basis of an updated analysis of indirect data3 (Methods). Widespread disruptions in the transport sector had the largest impact on emissions. By the end of 2020, COVID-19-related confinement measures were still acting to decrease daily emissions by around 7% below 2019 levels (Fig. 1b), with the largest share of the decrease also due to transport emissions. Here, we put the change in 2020 emissions in the context of the recent changes in fossil CO2 emissions in the 5?yr since the Paris Climate Agreement was adopted in 2015 and discuss the implications of COVID-19 for the evolution of global CO2 emissions. We focus on fossil CO2 emission which is the largest contributor to the rise in anthropogenic GHG.

The Paris Agreement builds on the Kyoto Protocol which was adopted in 1997, with commitments for emissions reductions for 36 mostly high-income economies (Methods). This so-called ‘Annex B’ country group accounted for 35% of global emissions in 2019 (12.5?GtCO2?yr?1). During the 5?yr since the Paris Agreement was adopted, emissions in the Annex B country group decreased by 0.10?GtCO2?yr?1 (–0.8%) on average each year (mean of 2016–2019 compared to 2011–2015), with a further decrease of about 1.2?GtCO2 (?9%) in 2020 alone due to the COVID-19 restrictions (Figs. 1 and 2).

Decreases in emissions were firmly set in motion by around 2005 among most (25) Annex B countries, whether accounting for emissions that occurred in a given country (territorial emissions) or around 5 years later based on all goods and services consumed in a given country even when produced elsewhere6 (consumption emissions; Extended Data Fig. 1). In the countries where emissions significantly decreased over more than a decade, previous analysis7 highlighted that the displacement of fossil energy by renewable energy and a decreasing use of energy were the common contributing factors, accounting for 47% and 36% of the decrease in emissions (median across countries), respectively. The size of the decrease in emissions across countries was correlated to the number of climate and energy policies in place7, with a separate study corroborating that indeed the policies drove the decrease in emissions8. The decreasing use of energy was also partly explained by low growth in gross domestic product (GDP) following the 2008–2009 global financial crisis.

As a group, the 99 upper-middle-income economies accounted for 51% of global emissions in 2019 (17.8?GtCO2?yr?1; Methods). Of the global total, 28% was from China alone. This is also the group where emissions have risen the most, with a median growth among countries of 30% between 2005 and 2019. However, the growth in emissions in this country group has slowed considerably in the past 5?yr, with mean annual growth of 0.14?GtCO2?yr?1 (+0.8%) on average each year (mean of 2016–2019 compared to 2011–2015), around five times less (half when excluding China) than the growth during the previous two 5-yr periods (in absolute value; Extended Data Fig. 1). Of the 99 countries in the group, 30 have shown decreases in emissions during 2016–2019 compared to 2011–2015 (Fig. 2), suggesting that action to reduce emissions is now in motion in many countries. The growing number of climate change laws and policies in place (over 2,000 worldwide9) appears to have played a key role in curbing the growth in emissions in the past 5?yr pre-COVID-19 (ref. 8). Emissions decreased by about 0.8?GtCO2 (?5%) in 2020 alone due to the COVID-19 restrictions (Fig. 1).

As a group, emissions originating from the 79 lower-middle-income and low-income economies are much lower than in the other two groups, accounting for 14% of global emissions in 2019 (4.9?GtCO2?yr?1; Methods). Emissions in this lower-income group have grown by 0.18?GtCO2?yr?1 (+4.5%) on average each year (mean of 2016–2019 compared to 2011–2015) with no notable slowdown at the group level (Extended Data Fig. 1). Emissions decreased in nine countries during that same time interval, although many following geopolitical instabilities (Fig. 2). Emissions decreased by about 0.4?GtCO2 (?9%) in 2020 alone due to the COVID-19 restrictions in that country group (Fig. 1). All countries considered, emissions decreased by 0.16 GtCO2 yr–1 on average each year among the 64 countries where emissions decreased (mean of 2016–2019 compared to 2011–2015), a tenth of what would be needed at the global level to meet the Paris climate goals, and increased 0.37 GtCO2 yr–1 among the 150 countries where emissions increased.

Although the measures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic will reduce emissions by about 7% in 2020, they will not, on their own, cause lasting decreases in emissions because these temporary measures have little impact on the fossil fuel-based infrastructure that sustains the world economy2. However, economic stimuli on national levels could soon change the course of global emissions if investments towards green infrastructure are enhanced while investments encouraging the use of fossil energy are reduced2,10. Announcements as of December 2020 (ref. 11) suggest substantial green stimulus packages with limited investments in fossil-based activities by the European Union, Denmark, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland, but investments continue to be overwhelmingly dominated by fossil fuels in most countries, including in the United States and China. Investments in response to the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 led to an immediate rebound of emissions to their pre-crisis trajectory by 2010 (ref. 12) (Fig. 1). Although a full rebound appears unlikely in 2021 (refs. 13,14,15) given the persistence of the pandemic and the effects of pre-COVID-19 climate policy7,8, it hinges to a large extent on the alignment of economic stimulus packages and other incentives with climate objectives2,16. Early data suggest economic drivers and other factors were driving global emissions up in December 2020, potentially offsetting the decrease caused by confinement measures4,17.

The disruption of emissions trajectories due to the COVID-19 pandemic means strategic actions now could minimize the rebound and reinforce cuts in global emissions in the long term. The nature of the disruptions in 2020 (ref. 18), particularly affecting transportation, suggest that incentives to expedite the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles, and to encourage and make space for active transport (safe walking and cycling) in cities, are timely. Support to improve and promote remote communications for businesses and organizations and regional tourism, in addition to encouraging a return to public transportation as soon as it is safe to do so, could reduce total transportation needs. The resilience of renewable energy production throughout the crisis13,19, falling costs and air quality benefits, are additional incentives to support large-scale deployment of renewable energy as a post-crisis measure, which is needed to provide low-carbon electricity. These measures could curb emissions immediately, minimizing the rebound and building momentum for a change in emissions trajectory in the long term. To be at the scale necessary to meet climate objectives, such post-COVID-19 actions need to deliver a tenfold increase in emissions cuts compared to those observed during 2016–2019 among decarbonizing countries, and be accompanied by a profound disinvestment in fossil fuel-based infrastructure worldwide.

Experience from several previous crises show that the underlying drivers of emissions reappear, if not immediately, then within a few years (Fig. 1). Therefore to change the trajectory in global CO2 emissions in the long term, the underlying drivers also need to change. The growing commitments by countries to reduce their emissions to net zero within decades provides a substantial strengthening of climate ambition. This is now backed by the three biggest emitters: China (by 2060 but with few details on scope), the United States (by 2050 as detailed in President Joe Biden’s electoral climate plan)20 and the European Commission (by 2050 with strengthened ambition of at least 55% reduction by 2030). The effective implementation of these ambitions, both within and beyond COVID-19 recovery plans, will be essential to change global emissions trajectory. Most current COVID-19 recovery plans are in direct contradiction with countries’ climate commitments11.

Year 2021 could mark the beginning of a new phase in tackling climate change. The science is established and international agreements are in place, with some evidence that growth in global CO2 emissions was already faltering before the COVID-19 pandemic. The task of sustaining decreases in global emissions of the order of billion tonnes of CO2 per year21, while supporting economic recovery and human development, and improved health, equity and well-being, lies in current and future actions. The pressing timeline is constantly underscored by the rapid unfolding of extreme climate impacts22.

Methods
Emissions for 1990–2019
This analysis is based solely on fossil CO2 emissions, which includes the combustion of fossil fuels, the production of cement and other process emissions, as fully described elsewhere1. For territorial emissions of the 41 countries that report their emissions to the United Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for 1990–2018, these reports are used directly. For territorial emissions of other countries, emissions estimates are from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) for the period 1990–2018 derived primarily from energy statistics published by the United Nations1,23. Territorial emissions are extended to 2019 using the growth rate in energy published by BP and converted to emissions using fuel-specific conversions1. The uncertainty is set to ±5% and represents ±1?s.d. Consumption emissions for 1990–2018 are estimated on the basis of trade data using established methods and are taken here directly from the Global Carbon Budget 2020 update1.

Emissions for 2020
The national changes in fossil CO2 emissions during 2020 are updates from a previous study published in May 2020 (ref. 3), and considers only the effect of the COVID-19 restrictions. Country emissions exclude international transport (aviation and shipping) as in UNFCCC guidelines, contrary to the original study3 which allocated international transport to the country where they originate. International transport here is accounted in the global emissions only. Changes in emissions are based on changes in activity for six sectors of the economy as a function of the level of confinement and uses emissions of CO2 in each sector for 71 countries representing 97% of the emissions and the degree of confinement for each country and each day of 2020. Compared to the original published study3 and the interim update1, the parameters for activity change were updated to incorporate new information that became available at the end of 2020 and further adjusted to fit available monthly data in the United States and India (Supplementary Information). These updates in parameters did not alter the results notably. The full range of uncertainty is for a decrease in 2020 emissions in the range 3–12%, from uncertainty in the activity parameters3.

Comparison of the 2020 decrease in emissions with other estimates
Compared to the published estimate, the changes in emissions from the COVID-19 restrictions during January–April 2020 is almost unchanged, with a minor update from 1.05 to 1.08?GtCO2 for the world, and with minor changes for individual countries other than the scope of excluding international transport (see above). The global change in fossil CO2 emissions in other estimates as updated in the Global Carbon Budget is for a 2020 decrease of 6% based on monthly energy data available for the United States, EU?27 and India, and GDP for the rest of the world, 7% based on the Carbon Monitor4 and 13% based on Google mobility data2, for a median value of 7% based on expert judgement1, also consistent with the assessment from the International Energy Agency of 8% (ref. 13).

Country groups follow the Annex B of the UNFCCC (with Monaco’s emissions here included in France) and the World Bank classification for lending groups in 2021 (ref. 24). A full list is provided in the Supplementary Information."
"Fossil fuels are a cheap and reliable way to produce energy. They work even when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing, and they’re very abundant—at least for now. So for countries with rising energy needs, it can be tempting to keep building fossil fuel plants despite their contribution to climate change.

This would be very harmful, says Noelle Selin, Associate Professor in the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society. Even if we could just ignore climate change, fossil fuels come with many hidden costs. ""A lot of fossil fuel plants have real detrimental effects on populations nearby, whether from the actual fossil fuel extraction, or because of air pollution,” says Selin. “Those costs aren't usually taken into account when people think about the potential risks or benefits for energy development, but they really should be.""

The term “fossil fuel” refers to any source of energy made from fossilized plants or animals. This organic matter is compressed and heated over millions of years until it forms coal, oil, or natural gas. The reason these fuels contribute to global warming is that burning them releases carbon dioxide (CO2).

But burning fossil fuels also produces other pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and soot. Soot is especially dangerous: when it’s small enough, we can inhale it into our lungs, causing asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer.1 And this is not a small problem. Health problems caused by air pollution lead to around 7 million deaths every year worldwide.2

Even if there isn’t a fossil fuel plant near your house, fossil fuels can still pollute your air. Americans are also exposed to air pollution from gasoline-burning cars—which, in the U.S., are also among the biggest contributors to climate change. “Cars and trucks emit nitrogen oxides; those form ozone in the atmosphere,” says Selin. “They also emit CO2. So gasoline-burning cars are contributing to ozone pollution. They’re contributing to local air quality problems, and also contributing to climate change.""

This means that many actions we might take to prevent climate change can also clean our air and prevent health problems. In fact, Selin says that “reducing fossil fuel use can actually pay for itself in health benefits, because populations will be healthier. This means fewer missed work days, fewer trips to the doctor.” These benefits add up quickly on a country-wide scale. More productivity at work grows the economy. So does less spending on healthcare, which frees governments to make more long-term investments in education or infrastructure.

Pollutants from fossil fuels also harm important ecosystems, like our waterways. The same gases that cause smog and damage our lungs eventually get absorbed into bodies of water, where they contribute to toxic algal blooms and oxygen-deprived areas that can kill off fish and other aquatic life.3 Transporting fossil fuels like oil also has its risks: accidents on oil tankers and offshore oil rigs can lead to oil spills that severely harm the environment and the economy. And even taking fossil fuels out of the ground is a dangerous job with real costs to society. Almost 200 coal miners have died on the job in the US over the past ten years,4 and over 10% of long-term American coal miners develop black lung disease.5

We’re used to thinking of policies to fight climate change as long-term investments which only pay out decades in the future. But if climate action includes cutting fossil fuels, we actually have a lot to gain right away. As Selin says, “There are benefits that societies and individuals and communities can see from cutting fossil fuel emissions in the very near term. And in a lot of cases, those benefits really are overwhelming—larger than the cost of mitigating climate change.” In 2018, Selin published a study in Nature Climate Change that showed these benefits in action using China’s greenhouse gas reduction goals.6 As part of the Paris Climate Accords, China pledged to stop increasing their CO2 emissions by 2030.7 If China manages this, the benefits of cleaner air—most notably, fewer deaths from air pollution—would be four times the cost of implementing the policy.

Studies like this show that moving away from burning fossil fuels can almost immediately begin to save lives and boost the economy. And at the same time, cutting fossil fuel usage protects us from the worst effects of future climate change."
"The SEI Initiative on Fossil Fuels and Climate Change creates a platform for high-quality, timely, and policy-relevant research and communications on how fossil fuel supply can be aligned with climate goals, while ensuring a just and equitable transition for communities in producing regions.

Most fossil fuel reserves will need to be left in the ground if we are to avoid dangerous climate change and meet the Paris Agreement’s goal of keeping global warming “well below” 2°C. This is a daunting challenge. For many countries, fossil fuel extraction and trade are central to energy security and economic development. There is also limited knowledge about climate-related policy interventions that might affect future patterns of fossil-fuel production.

The SEI Initiative on Fossil Fuels and Climate Change advances knowledge on this topic, both through research and by helping build a “community of practice” on the connection between fossil fuel supply, climate change, and development. It builds on SEI’s partnerships and capacity-building activities around the world, engaging recognized leaders on climate change mitigation, energy modelling, political economy, equity and the climate change negotiations.

The Initiative investigates:

The emissions implications of new fossil fuel production, and the risks and benefits of policies that might curtail them
How political economy shapes decisions about fossil fuel development in individual countries
The role of international institutions and governance on addressing fossil fuel supply, including how the supply side can be better integrated into the UNFCCC process and how fossil fuels intersect with SDGs
How a transition away from fossil fuels can address equity concerns and development needs, especially in communities currently dependent on fossil fuel production
Through this research, policy-makers, international organizations, businesses and civil society gain a better understanding of how the institutions, investments and infrastructure that support fossil fuel production can lock in dependence on fossil fuels – and how societies can move away from such dependency. Through communications, SEI is raising the profile of supply-side climate policy, both in the literature and among policy-makers

The Initiative’s work serves as a foundation for debates and discussions on local, national and international scales. The Initiative has established the International Conference on Fossil Fuel Supply and Climate Change – held in 2016 and 2018, with multiple partners and sponsors  – which brings together policy-makers, researchers, and civil society actors to spark new ideas, new research and new connections.

Its research also contributes to local and regional debates on fossil fuel production. Recent reports, for example, tackle topics such as how Colombia can plan for a future without coal and the complex dynamics surrounding Indonesia’s coal production, as well as how Canada’s oil sands can contribute to carbon lock-in and how limiting oil production can help California meet its climate goals. A journal article in Climatic Change examines whether constraining US fossil fuel production would affect global CO2 emissions.

The Initiative’s work on international institutions and governance includes journal articles, op-eds and policy briefs. An article in Climate Policy, for example, outlined reasons why it is important to address fossil fuel supply under the UNFCCC, and a policy brief served as a submission to the UNFCCC Talanoa Dialogue. The initiative (and SEI) participated in the Dialogue in a session on “Where do we want to go?”

The Initiative is also examining how social mobilization factors into climate change policy-making. A recent article in Climate Policy explored the influence of social movements on policies that constrain fossil fuel supply.

This work has helped raise awareness of the need to look at both supply and demand when crafting climate change policies. The body of research on this topic continues to grow, and policy-makers have begun to enact policies aimed at limiting fossil fuel supply – such as moratoriums on further offshore development in New Zealand and France.

Our goal is to continue to deepen understanding, build a thriving community of practice, and contribute to practical policy development at the national and international levels."
"Burning any carbon based fuel converts carbon to carbon dioxide. Unless it is captured and stored, this carbon dioxide is usually released to the atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon that was removed from the atmosphere millions of years ago by animal and plant life. This leads to increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Why is Carbon dioxide a problem?
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of a number of gases that are transparent to the visible light falling on the Earth from the Sun, but absorb the infra-red radiation (heat) emitted by the warm surface of the Earth, preventing its loss into space. During the geological history of the Earth the level of atmospheric CO2 has varied considerably and this has had an impact on the global temperature. A significant amount of this atmospheric carbon was sequestered or (removed from the atmosphere) and turned into inert material (coal, and oil) typically 300-360 Million years ago. All of the global ecosystems and species have adapted to a lower level of atmospheric CO2 and critically, human civilisation has also grown since that period.

Since the industrial revolution humans have been burning sequestered CO2 in the form of coal, oil, and natural gas which has the result of releasing energy but also releases CO2 back into the atmosphere.

"The future of fossil fuels
Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide (CO2). This is bad for the climate. Fossil fuel reserves can also run out. That’s why central government wants the Netherlands to have a low-carbon economy by 2050. It’s providing incentives for businesses to make the transition to sustainable energy.

The transition to sustainable energy
By 2020 14% of all energy used in the Netherlands must be sustainable. And by 2050, almost all energy must be from sustainable sources. Companies who fail to make the transition will have no place in a low-carbon economy.

Stricter requirements for coal-fired power plants
90% of mined coal is used as fuel. Most of the Netherlands’ electricity is generated in coal-fired power plants. Burning coal releases CO2. In the Netherlands CO2 is stored in empty gas fields under the sea bed.

Coal is a cheap fossil fuel, but causes a lot of pollution. So coal-fired power plants have to meet strict standards. If a plant’s CO2 emissions are too high, the owner must make changes that reduce the emissions.

The new, tougher standards have an impact on most older, more polluting coal-fired power plants in the Netherlands, built in the 1980s. It will be harder to make them meet the new standards.

Five coal-fired power plants to close by 1 July 2017
The Netherlands has 10 coal-fired power plants. Five of them are scheduled to close by 1 July 2017. The other five will remain open because the Netherlands still needs them for the time being.

These five are the most modern coal power plants in Europe, and their CO2 emissions are low. This is partly because they are cofired with biomass. This causes less pollution.

Impact of coal mining on the subsurface
Coal was mined in the southern Dutch province of Limburg until the end of 1974. This may have current and future consequences for the region’s subsurface. That’s why the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (EZK) commissioned a study of the effects of coal mining in Limburg. The findings showed that there are no direct risks to public safety and no danger of ground water pollution.

Tougher standards for natural gas production
98% of Dutch households use gas for cooking and to heat their homes. Safety is a prime concern in the Dutch gas industry. The Mining Act sets out rules, for example:

Companies must carry out extensive studies into possible risks before they can apply for a permit to extract gas.
A new Mining Act is currently being drafted. The amendments will tighten up the rules for gas extraction.

Natural gas extraction in Groningen
Most of the country’s natural gas is extracted from the Groninger field near Slochteren, in the north of the Netherlands. Gas extraction in Groningen has caused earthquakes, so the government has decided to extract less gas in this area. There are over 250 other gas fields in the Netherlands, both onshore and below the North Sea.

The Netherlands still depends on oil
The Netherlands still depends greatly on oil, especially for industry and transport. It is used as a fuel and as a raw material for producing plastics. Because the supply is not always guaranteed, the government keeps strategic reserves.

The Netherlands has also worked with other countries to develop an oil crisis policy, so government can restrict the use of oil in a crisis. For instance, it can temporarily lower the speed limit on motorways or introduce car-free Sundays.

Central government stimulates the use of alternative fuels like biodiesel and other biofuels.

Permits for mineral resource exploration and extraction
Businesses need a permit to explore for and extracting mineral resources like oil and gas. The Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy issues these permits. The State Supervision of Mines is the oversight body for minerals exploration and extraction."
"Fossil fuel ""addiction"" is rapidly worsening climate change as the related effects of extreme weather leave 98 million people facing severe food insecurity and heat-related deaths surge, a new report warns.

The big picture: The burning of fossil fuels including coal, oil and natural gas that cause toxic air pollution kills some 11,800 Americans and about 1.2 million people globally every year, according to the report, published in the medical journal The Lancet Tuesday ahead of next month's UN Cop27 climate summit in Egypt.

What they found: The annual Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change report examined 103 countries and found that the global land area impacted by extreme drought — like the one gripping much of the U.S. West — had grown by 29% in the past 50 years.

Heat-related deaths jumped 68% between 2017-2021, compared to 2000-2004, as exposure to days of very-high or extremely-high fire danger rose in 61% of countries from 2001–2004 to 2018–2021, the University College London-led study found.
Heat exposure led to 470 billion potential labour hours lost globally in 2021, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries and worsening the impact of the cost-of-living crisis.
Of note: Global warming is leading to the spread of infectious diseases, per the report — which involved 99 researchers from 51 institutions, including the World Health Organization and the World Meteorological Organization

Malaria transmission rose 32.1% in highland areas of the Americas and 14.9% in Africa in 2012-2021, compared to the 1950s.
State of play: Jeni Miller, executive director of the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said in an emailed statement accompanying the report that ""fossil fuel-driven climate change is reducing family incomes due to heat waves that impact worker productivity.""

It's also ""aggravating food insecurity through diminished crop yields"" and the ""worst impacts of fossil fuel-driven climate change are being felt by developing countries — those least responsible for having caused it.""
Meanwhile, the carbon intensity of the global energy system, the biggest single contributing sector to global greenhouse gas emissions, has dropped by less than 1% from 1992 levels, according to the report.

Zoom in: Researchers found 69 out of the 86 governments analyzed in the report subsidized fossil fuels at a collective cost of $400 billion in 2019

Governments ""have so far failed to provide the smaller sum of $100 billion per year to help support climate action in lower income countries,"" the study noted.
The bottom line: ""The world is edging closer to multiple tipping points that, once crossed, will drive temperatures well above 2°C ... current global actions are insufficient,"" the researchers warn in a linked editorial published in The Lancet.

What they're saying: ""The climate crisis is killing us,"" said United Nations Secretary-General, António Guterres in a statement responding to the report, as he called for ""common-sense investments in renewable energy.""

Between the lines: The report's description of fossil fuel use as an addiction is accurate, said the University of Maryland's Sacoby Wilson and University of Calgary's Courtney Howard, who weren't involved in the report, per AP.

Howard, a professor of medicine, noted the increase in heat deaths hadn't thwarted fossil fuel use and the ""continuing in habitual behavior despite known harms"" was the definition of addiction.
Environmental health professor Wilson told AP the report underscores that people ""are dying now"" from climate change's effects. ""Droughts, desertification, not having food, flooding, tsunamis,"" Wilson said, citing the deadly floods that devastated Pakistan and Nigeria this year."
"The evidence is clear: the main cause of climate change is burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal. When burnt, fossil fuels release carbon dioxide into the air, causing the planet to heat up.

What causes climate change?
The climate on Earth has been changing since it formed 4.5 billion years ago. Until recently, natural factors have been the cause of these changes. Natural influences on the climate include volcanic eruptions, changes in the orbit of the Earth, and shifts in the Earth's crust (known as plate tectonics).

Over the past one million years, the Earth has experienced a series of ice ages, including cooler periods (glacials) and warmer periods (interglacials). Glacial and interglacial periods cycle roughly every 100,000 years, caused by changes in Earth's orbit around the sun. For the past few thousand years, Earth has been in an interglacial period with a constant temperature.

However, since the Industrial Revolution in the 1800s, the global temperature has increased at a much faster rate. By burning fossil fuels and changing how we use the land, human activity has quickly become the leading cause of changes to our climate.


How does the climate system work?

Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect
Some gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat and stop it escaping into space. We call these 'greenhouse gases'. These gases act as a warming blanket around the Earth, known as the 'greenhouse effect'.

Greenhouse gases come from both human and natural sources. Gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide naturally occur in the atmosphere. Others, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), are only produced by human activity.

When short-wave radiation from the sun reaches Earth, most of it passes straight through and hits the surface. The Earth absorbs most of this radiation and gives off longer-wavelength infrared radiation.

The greenhouse gases absorb some of this infrared radiation, instead of it passing straight out into space. The atmosphere then emits radiation in all directions, sending some of it back to the surface, causing the planet to heat up. This process is known as the 'greenhouse effect'.

The greenhouse effect is critical to our survival. In fact, without greenhouse gases, Earth would be about 30 degrees colder than it is today. Without greenhouse gases and their warming effect, we wouldn't be able to survive.

However, since the Industrial Revolution, we've been adding more and more greenhouse gases into the air, trapping even more heat. Instead of keeping Earth at a warm, stable temperature, the greenhouse effect is heating the planet at a much faster rate. We call this the 'enhanced greenhouse effect' and it's the main cause of climate change.

Human causes of climate change
Humans cause climate change by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air. Today, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than there ever has been in at least the past 2 million years. During the 20th and 21st century, the level of carbon dioxide rose by 40%.

We produce greenhouse gases in lots of different ways:

Burning fossil fuels – Fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal contain carbon dioxide that has been 'locked away' in the ground for thousands of years. When we take these out of the land and burn them, we release the stored carbon dioxide into the air.
Deforestation – Forests remove and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Cutting them down means that carbon dioxide builds up quicker since there are no trees to absorb it. Not only that, trees release the carbon they stored when we burn them.
Agriculture – Planting crops and rearing animals releases many different types of greenhouse gases into the air. For example, animals produce methane, which is 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. The nitrous oxide used for fertilisers is ten times worse and is nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide!
Cement – Producing cement is another contributor to climate change, causing 2% of our entire carbon dioxide emissions.
Natural changes to the climate
The leading cause of climate change is human activity and the release of greenhouse gases. However, there are lots of natural causes that also lead to changes in the climate system.

Natural cycles can cause the climate to alternate between warming and cooling. There are also natural factors that force the climate to change, known as 'forcings'. Even though these natural causes contribute to climate change, we know that they are not the primary cause, based on scientific evidence.

Some of these natural cycles include:

Milankovitch cycles – As Earth travels around the sun, its path and the tilt of its axis can change slightly. These changes, called Milankovitch cycles, affect the amount of sunlight that falls on Earth. This can cause the temperature of Earth to change. However, these cycles take place over tens or hundreds of thousands of years and are unlikely to be causing the changes to the climate that we are seeing today.
El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) – ENSO is a pattern of changing water temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. In an 'El Niño' year, the global temperature warms up, and in a 'La Niña' year, it cools down. These patterns can affect the global temperature for a short amount of time (months or years) but cannot explain the persistent warming that we see today.

What is El Niño, what does it mean and how does it affect weather around the world?

Natural forcings that can contribute to climate change include:

Solar irradiance – Changing energy from the sun has affected the temperature of Earth in the past. However, we have not seen anything strong enough to change our climate. Any increase in solar energy would make the entire atmosphere of Earth warm, but we can only see warming in the bottom layer.
Volcanic eruptions – Volcanoes have a mixed effect on our climate. Eruptions produce aerosol particles that cool Earth, but they also release carbon dioxide, which warms it. Volcanoes produce 50 times less carbon dioxide than humans do, so we know they are not the leading cause of global warming. On top of this, cooling is the dominant effect of volcanic eruptions, not warming.
Are humans responsible for climate change?
When looking at all the evidence, there is a large scientific consensus that humans are the leading cause of climate change. In their latest report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated unequivocally that human activity is the cause of global warming.

Natural climate cycles can change the temperature of Earth, but the changes we are seeing are happening at a scale and speed that natural cycles cannot explain. These cycles affect the global temperature for years, or sometimes just months, not the 100 years that we have observed. Meanwhile, longer-term changes like Milankovitch cycles and solar irradiance take thousands and thousands of years.

There are lots of things that affect climate change, but the evidence is irrefutable. Human activity, such as burning fossil fuels and changing how we use the land, is the leading cause of climate change."
"ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH COAL, OIL, AND GAS
Over the past quarter century, we have come to realize that there is more to life than material goods and services, that ""some of the best things in life are free."" The pleasure we derive from breathing fresh air, drinking pure water, and enjoying the beauty that nature has provided is priceless and must not be sacrificed. Moreover, losing them will lead directly or indirectly to incalculable economic losses. We have come to appreciate the importance of our environment.

Much has been said and written about environmental problems with nuclear power, and they will be discussed at great length in this book. But in this chapter, we consider the wide variety of environmental problems in burning fossil fuels — coal, oil, and gas. They probably exceed those of any other human activity. The ones that have received the most publicity in recent years have been the ""greenhouse effect,"" which is changing the Earth's climate; acid rain, which is destroying forests and killing fish; and air pollution, which is killing tens of thousands of American citizens every year, while making tens of millions ill and degrading our quality of life in other ways. We will discuss each of these in turn, and then summarize some of the other problems that have drawn lesser attention. But first we must begin with some basics.

Coal, oil, and gas consist largely of carbon and hydrogen. The process that we call ""burning"" actually is chemical reactions with oxygen in the air. For the most part, the carbon combines with oxygen to form carbon dioxide (CO2), and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water vapor (H20). In both of these chemical reactions a substantial amount of energy is released as heat. Since heat is what is needed to instigate these chemical reactions, we have a chain reaction: reactions cause heat, which causes reactions, which cause heat, and so on. Once started the process continues until nearly all of the fuel has gone through the process (i.e., burned), or until something is done to stop it. Of course, the reason for arranging all this is to derive the heat.

The carbon dioxide that is released is the cause of the greenhouse effect we will be discussing. A large coal-burning plant annually burns 3 million tons of coal to produce 11 million tons of carbon dioxide. The water vapor release presents no problems, since the amount in the atmosphere is determined by evaporation from the oceans — if more is produced by burning, that much less will be evaporated from the seas.

THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT

Electromagnetic radiation is an exceedingly important physical phenomenon that takes various forms depending on its wavelength. (The concept of wavelength is most easily understood for water waves, where it is the distance between successive crests. For electromagnetic waves it is the distance between successive peaks of the electric and magnetic fields.) Ordinary radios use the longest wavelengths of interest, 200 to 600 meters for AM stations. FM radio and television use wavelengths from a few meters (UHF) to less than 1 meter (VHF). Microwaves, familiar from the ovens that employ them, and radar, which plays a vital role in military applications and is also used by the police to catch speeders, have shorter wavelengths, in the range of centimeters to millimeters. Visible light is electromagnetic waves with much shorter wave lengths, ranging from 0.0004 millimeters for purple to 0.00055 millimeters for green to 0.0007 millimeters for red. Wavelengths between where visibility ends (0.0008 millimeters) and the microwave region begins (0.1 millimeters) are called infrared.

Every object in the universe constantly emits electromagnetic radiation, and absorbs (or reflects) that which impinges on it. According to the laws of physics, the wavelength of the emitted radiation decreases inversely as the temperature increases. (Here we use absolute temperature, which is Fahrenheit temperature plus 460 degrees). For example, the filament of a light bulb, which is typically at 6,000 degrees absolute, emits visible (yellow) light, while our bodies, which are normally at 559 degrees absolute (460 + 98.6), emit radiation of about 11 times longer wavelength, which is in the infrared region and therefore not visible — that's why we don't glow in the dark. More applicable to our discussion is the surface of the sun, which is at 11,000 degrees and therefore emits visible light as we can plainly see, and the surface of the Earth which, at about 520 degrees, emits infrared, as we know from the fact that it is not visible on a dark night.

The rate at which an object emits radiation energy increases very rapidly with increasing temperature (doubling the absolute temperature increases the radiation 16-fold). That's why a hand placed near a light bulb is heated much more by radiation from the filament when it is hot (light on) than when it is cool (light off). Now let us consider a bare object out in space, such as our moon. It receives and absorbs radiation from the sun, which increases its temperature, and this increased temperature causes it to emit more radiation. Through this process it comes to an equilibrium temperature, where the amount of radiation it emits is just equal to the amount it receives from the sun. That determines the average temperature of the moon. If this were the whole story, our Earth would be 54 degrees cooler than it actually is, and nearly all land would be covered by ice.

The reason for the difference is that the Earth's atmosphere contains molecules that absorb infrared radiation. They do not absorb the visible radiation coming in from the sun, so the Earth gets its full share of that. But a fraction of the infrared emitted by the Earth is absorbed by these molecules which then reemit it, frequently back to the Earth. That is what provides the extra heating. This is also the process that warms the plants in a greenhouse — the glass roof does not absorb the visible light coming in from the sun, but the infrared radiation emitted from the plants is absorbed by the glass and much of it is radiated back to the plants. That is how the process got its name — greenhouse effect. It is also the cause of automobiles getting hot when parked in the sun; the incoming visible radiation passes through the glass windows, while the infrared emitted from the car's interior is absorbed by the glass and much of it is emitted back into the interior.

Molecules in the atmosphere that absorb infrared and thereby increase the Earth's temperature are called greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide is an efficient greenhouse gas. The atmosphere of Venus contains vast quantities of carbon dioxide, elevating its temperature by 500 degrees over what it would be without an atmosphere. That's why no astronaut will ever be able to land on Venus. Mars, on the other hand, has no atmosphere and is at the temperature expected from the simple considerations discussed above in connection with our moon.

Our problem is that burning coal, oil, and gas produces carbon dioxide, which adds to the supply already in the atmosphere, increasing the greenhouse effect and thereby increasing the temperature of the Earth. Prior to the industrial age, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was less than 280 ppm (parts per million). This was determined from analyzing air bubbles, trapped hundreds or thousands of years ago in the Antarctic and Greenland ice caps. By 1958 the carbon dioxide concentration had risen to 315 ppm, and by 1986 it was 350 ppm. The average temperature of the Earth has been about 1 degree warmer in the 20th century than in the 19th century, which is close to what is expected from this carbon dioxide increase. As the rate of burning coal, oil, and gas escalates, so too does the rate of increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Predicting the increase of temperature expected from this is very complicated, but since it is so important, a great deal of effort has gone into deriving estimates. Results are usually discussed in terms of doubling the concentration of carbon dioxide, from 350 ppm to 700 ppm. If current trends continue, this will occur during the next century, perhaps as early as 2030.1 The direct effect of doubling the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would be to raise the Earth's average temperature by 2.2°F. Two side effects will accentuate this temperature rise. One is that the increased temperature causes more water to evaporate from the oceans, which adds to the number of water molecules in the atmosphere; water vapor is also a greenhouse gas. The other is that there would be less ice and snow; these reflect away the visible light from the sun that would otherwise be absorbed by the Earth's surface.

There are many other factors of lesser importance that must be considered. Some of these factors tend to reduce the warming effect:

Clouds, generated by the increased evaporation of water, intercept some of the radiation coming in from the sun and emit part of it back into outer space.
Volcanoes inject lots of dust into the atmosphere; this dust reflects sunlight away from the Earth.
Plankton, tiny marine organisms whose growth is accelerated by carbon dioxide and higher temperatures, absorb carbon dioxide, thereby taking it out of circulation.
Oceans absorb both carbon dioxide and heat.
Yet other complicating processes accentuate the warming:

Sulfur dioxide, a pollutant we will be discussing soon, tends to cool the Earth, and in our efforts to eliminate pollution we are reducing this cooling effect.
Thawing of permafrost, soil that has been frozen for thousands of years, releases methane (natural gas), which is a greenhouse gas.
Bacteria in soil convert dead organic matter into carbon dioxide more rapidly as temperatures rise, thus increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
When all of these factors are taken into account as accurately as possible with our present knowledge, the best estimates are that doubling the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will increase the average temperature by about 7°F. The uncertainty in this estimate is large; the true increase might be as little as 3 or as much as 15°F.

The importance of this greenhouse effect has become a public issue because of the recent abnormally hot summers accompanied by droughts that have severely reduced our agricultural output. Averaged over the Earth, the five warmest years in the past century have been in the 1980s, this despite the facts that the sun's energy output has been below normal and that there has been major volcanic activity, which would ordinarily reduce temperatures as explained above. Whether or not this recent abnormally warm weather is a manifestation of the increasing greenhouse effect is somewhat debatable, but unquestionably the greenhouse effect will become important sooner or later if we continue to use fossil fuels. There is, therefore, a strong consensus in both the scientific and environmentalist communities that the greenhouse effect should be given high-priority attention.

Since our emphasis here is the generation of electricity, we have concentrated our discussion on carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, but that is only part of the story on the greenhouse effect. Other aspects are discussed in the Chapter 3 Appendix. We now turn our attention to the consequences of this global warming.

PREDICTED CONSEQUENCES OF THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT

In December 1987, the U.S. Congress requested a report from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the health and environmental consequences expected from the greenhouse effect. The following discussion is based on that report.2

Agriculture is especially sensitive to climate. For example, the hot, dry summer of 1988 reduced corn yields in the Midwest by 40%. But with long-term planning, crops can be changed to compensate for climate change. Moreover, increased levels of carbon dioxide would have beneficial effects on agriculture, since carbon dioxide in the air is the principal source of material from which plants produce food.

The EPA's assessment is that the South will be hard hit, as the temperature becomes too hot for most of its crops, especially soybeans and corn. Florida is an exception, as citrus growing will be helped and tropical fruits can become a major new product. The Great Lakes region will be helped by the longer growing season. Crop yields in Minnesota will be increased 50-100%, with much lesser benefits elsewhere. Corn growing will become difficult in Illinois, but it can be replaced by sorghum. The Great Plains region will suffer the most, as it is already somewhat marginal for agriculture. Its major crops, wheat and corn, will probably have to be abandoned.

Live stock problems will increase. Heat stress will reduce breeding. Some of the live stock diseases that now plague the South will shift northward, and new tropical diseases will invade the South. Problems with agricultural pests will multiply. More pests will survive over the warmer winters, and they will breed more generations over the longer summers.

In summary, while there will be lots of disruptions and requirements for adjustment, the EPA does not expect food shortages to become critical in the United States. Problems could be more difficult in other parts of the world.

Forests will undergo some hard times. Each type of tree requires a specific climate. Thus, the growing area for each species will shift northward by 100 to 600 miles. This sounds innocuous, but adjustment periods will be difficult, with lots of die-off in the South and slow build-up in the North. Forests are constantly under stress from insects, diseases, competition with other plants, fires, wind, and the like. The added stress of changing climate is certain to cause trouble. A great deal of research and planning will be needed to cope with it.

A substantial fraction of U.S. cities are on seacoasts and thus close to sea level — Boston, New York, Baltimore, Washington, Miami, New Orleans, Houston, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, to name a few. If all snow and ice were to melt, sea level would rise by 270 feet, enough to inundate nearly all of these cities and vast other areas of the nation. If present trends continue, there will be a 20-foot rise in 200-500 years. A reasonable estimate for the middle of the next century is 1.5-3 feet. A 3-foot rise would flood major areas in Boston, New York, Charleston, Miami, and especially New Orleans, and in all would reduce the land area of the United States by an area equal to that of the state of Massachusetts. Most of this land loss would be in Louisiana and Florida. The barrier islands off our coasts, including Atlantic City and Miami Beach, would be in severe trouble.

In general, each 1-foot rise in sea level moves the coastline back 50 to 100 feet in the northeast, 200 feet in the Carolinas, 200 to 400 feet in California, 100 to 1,000 feet in Florida, and a few miles in Louisiana. The flooding now caused by storms once in 100 years would be expected about every 15 years. Since hurricanes are generated in warm water (above 79°F), more of them would be expected.

Inland penetration of salt water would cause lots of difficulties for aquatic life. This is already reducing oyster harvests in Chesapeake Bay. New York City derives its drinking water from the Hudson River just above the present penetration of salt water; that would have to be changed. Philadelphia and several other cities have similar problems. Contamination of groundwater with salt would be a widespread problem, especially in Florida.

For valuable land, like cities, effective measures can be taken to control flooding from rising sea levels. Dikes can be built with large capacity pump-out systems to handle overflow as in Holland. This can be used to protect major U. S. cities against a 6-foot rise in sea level for $30-100 billion. New buildings can be constructed on higher ground, back from the shore. Fill can be added to raise the land used for new construction. Again there will be lots of problems, but with wise planning, they can be solved or at least delayed.

There is also a concern for wetlands, which are important for waterfowl and some types of aquatic life. It would take only a small rise in sea level to cut the total U.S. wetlands in half.

Rising ocean levels do not necessarily mean rising levels in rivers and streams. For example, the levels of the Great Lakes are predicted to fall 2-5 feet, due to the greenhouse effect reducing rainfall and increasing evaporation. This will cause problems with shipping and with water supplies for cities and towns.

Wild animals and plants must adapt to climate changes, and there are many potential difficulties. In some situations, animals can simply move, but not always. The grizzly bears in Yellowstone park would have no place to go and probably would die out. Other casualties of the greenhouse effect will probably be panthers, bald eagles, and spotted owls.

Insect plagues can be expected to cause lots of problems for trees, as will increased floods and droughts. Forest fires will occur more frequently. Acid rain problems, to be discussed later, will become worse. It will not be an easy time for forests or the animals that inhabit them.

While all of these things are going on in the United States, the rest of the world will also be affected. When one thinks of rising sea levels, Holland comes to mind. Two-thirds of its land area is now below sea level, and even now it is protected by dikes against a 16-foot rise in sea level during storms. For $5-10 billion, Holland can be protected against a further 3-foot rise. Technology really helps in this matter. Bangladesh, with its low-technology society, is expected to suffer terribly from flooding as the sea level rises.

One would think that Canada would benefit from warmer climates, but there are many complications. With the oceans rising and the Great Lakes water levels falling, the St. Lawrence seaway will be in trouble. Southern Ontario, which has the most productive farmland in Canada, may suffer from drought as storm tracks and the rain they bring move north, and warmer temperatures cause increased evaporation. The western wheat belt will also be threatened by drought. But aside from these local problems, in general the greenhouse effect causes agriculture to move northward, and Canada can accommodate a lot of northward movement. The tree line moves north by about 35 miles for each degree Fahrenheit of global temperature rise.

Most of the above discussion is based on what will happen by the middle of the next century. But that is not the end of it. As long as we burn fossil fuels, the Earth's climate will continue to get warmer. The only solution is to strongly reduce our burning of coal, oil, and gas. Substituting nuclear energy for coal burning to generate electricity, and the substitution of electricity for oil and gas in heating buildings and to some extent in transportation, can play an important role in this process.

ACID RAIN

In addition to combining carbon and hydrogen from the fuel with oxygen from the air to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor, burning fossil fuels involves other processes. Coal and oil contain small amounts of sulfur, typically 0.5% to 3% by weight. In the combustion process, sulfur combines with oxygen in the air to produce sulfur dioxide, which is the most important contributor to acid rain. Air consists of a mixture of oxygen (20%) and nitrogen (79%), and at very high temperatures molecules of these can combine to produce nitrogen oxides, the other important cause of acid rain. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere to become sulfuric acid and nitric acid, respectively, dissolved in water droplets that eventually may fall to the ground as rain. This rain is therefore acidic.

Chemists measure acidity in terms of pH, on a scale which varies from 0 to 14. On this scale, a pH of 0 is maximum acidity, a pH of 7 is neutral, and a pH of 14 is maximum alkalinity, which is the opposite of acidity. Each unit of pH represents a factor of 10 in acidity. For example, a pH of 4 is 10 times more acidic than a pH of 5. Some examples of pH values are 1.2 for the sulfuric acid in automobile batteries, 2 for lemon juice or vinegar, 3 for apple juice, 4 for tomato juice, 5 for carrot juice, 6.3 for milk, 7.3 for blood, 8.5 for soap, and 13 for lye, which is almost a pure alkali.

We have seen that there is a substantial amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This dissolves in water droplets to form carbonic acid, familiar to us as carbonated water or soda water. As a result, ""natural"" rain is somewhat acidic, with a pH of about 5.6. Other natural factors, such as volcanic activity, also contribute, causing wide variations in pH. Rainfall pH as low as 4.0 has been observed even in places remote from the effects of fuel burning, like Antarctica and the Indian Ocean.

There is evidence that rain is made appreciably more acidic by the sulfuric and nitric acid from fossil fuel burning. For example, one study indicated that in the eastern United States, the pH of rain was in the range 4.1-4.5 in the 1980s versus 4.5-5.6 in the 1950s.

After the rain falls, it percolates through the ground, dissolving materials out of the soil. This alters its pH and introduces other materials into the water. If the soil is alkaline, the water's acidity will be neutralized, but if it is acid, the acidity of the water may increase. This water is used by plants and trees for their sustenance, and eventually flows into rivers and lakes. There have been various reports indicating that streams and lakes have been getting more acidic in recent years, although the effects seem to be highly variable and not closely correlated with releases of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. A study of Adirondacks lakes between 1975 and 1985 found that one-quarter became more acid, one-quarter (including some less than 5 miles away) became less acid, and the rest were unchanged. These findings were clearly inconclusive. Among other thins, acid rain most frequently discussed are makes lakes unlivable for fish and other aquatic life and destroys forests. On both of these matters, the evidence is highly complex and took many years to develop, and it is still not completely unequivocal. But by now most scientists are convinced that the effects are real and serious in some areas.

One of the problems is that it is difficult to be certain about any specific area. Of the 50,000 lakes in the northeastern United States, 220, mostly in the Adirondacks mountains of New York, have no fish because the water is too acidic. Since tourism is very important in the Adirondacks region, this has had serious economic consequences that may be ascribed to acid rain, and the residents are very upset about it. On the other hand, there is no evidence that there ever were fish in those lakes. The surrounding soil is naturally highly acidic, which is surely at least partially responsible for the lakes' acidity. Moreover, there is no indication that the acidity has been changing in recent years.

A National Academy of Sciences committee3 investigated the problem by estimating the acidity prior to 1800. They analyzed fossil remains of microorganisms in the lake bottom sediments. Of the nine Adirondacks lakes for which these data and information on fish populations are available, six showed clear signs of increased acidity. For example, the pH of Big Moose Lake fell from 5.8 prior to 1800 to 4.9 at present, and the number of fish species in the lake declined from 10 in 1948 to 5 or 6 in 1962. It would normally take many hundreds or thousands of years for this large a change to take place through natural processes. The National Academy of Sciences Committee concluded that acid rain is responsible for these changes.

The problem of forest destruction is at least equally complicated. The most elaborate study was done in Germany, where a serious blight on trees has been in action.4 In 1982 it affected 8% of all West German trees, and by 1987, 52% were affected. Since Germans revere their forests, this is a high-priority issue for them. At the time when the political issue of installation of Pershing nuclear missiles on German soil reached its highest pitch, a poll found that the death of forests was the greatest concern of the German public.

A study of one particular forest concluded that the trees were under stress from a variety of factors but acid rain was ""the straw that broke the camel's back."" It dissolved aluminum out of the soil — about 5% of all soil is aluminum — and this toxic element was picked up by the roots of trees. Not only did the toxicity of aluminum cause direct damage to the trees, but aluminum was picked up instead of calcium and magnesium, which are crucial to a tree's nutrition. The problem was compounded by the nitric acid in the rain acting as fertilizer to accelerate the trees' growth at a time when important nutrients were lacking. Because of this stress, the trees were succumbing to what would normally be non-lethal attacks by insects compounded by drought.

Trees are suffering blight in many parts of the world, and acid rain is suspected of contributing to the problem. A prime example are spruce trees in the Appalachian mountains, which are dying off from New England to North Carolina. In this situation, the trees are at a high altitude where they are engulfed in a mist a large fraction of the time. Acidity in the mist is believed to be an important contributor to the damage — acidity that has the same origin as acid rain, mainly emissions from coal-burning plants.

Some of the most important problems caused by acid rain are political. The sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that cause acid rain originate far away, in other states or in other countries. The acid rain that is damaging lakes and forests in the eastern United States and Canada originates in coal-burning power plants in the Midwest. (Midwestern lakes and forests are not damaged by these emissions because soil in that region is naturally less acidic.) The acid rain that damages lakes and forests in Scandinavia originates in Britain and Western Europe, and the latter also contributes to damaging German forests. It is only natural for people to be very upset by losses caused by others, and they are demanding action.

Acid rain from U.S. sources is a top priority political issue in Canada. In any meetings between leaders of the two countries, the Canadians insist that it be high on the agenda. They insist on U.S. action to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions, and because of the high value we place on Canadian friendship, they will probably get it. In 1989, the Bush Administration introduced new clean air legislation that requires cutting sulfur dioxide emissions in half by the end of the century. It is estimated that this will increase the cost of electricity from coal burning by about 20%. This still does not face the problem of nitrogen oxides, for which there is no very effective control technology.

AIR POLLUTION

The greenhouse effect and acid rain have received more media attention and hence more public concern than general air pollution. This is difficult to understand, because the greenhouse effect causes only economic disruption, and acid rain kills only fish and trees, whereas air pollution kills people and causes human suffering through illness.

We have already described the processes that produce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which are important components of air pollution as well as the cause of acid rain. But many other processes are also involved in burning fossil fuels. When carbon combines with oxygen, sometimes carbon monoxide, a dangerous gas, is produced instead of carbon dioxide. Thousands of other compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, classified as hydrocarbons or volatile organic compounds, are also produced in the burning of fossil fuels. During combustion, some of the carbon remains unburned, and some other materials in coal and oil are not combustible; these come off as very small solid particles, called particulates, which are typically less than one ten thousandth of an inch in diameter, and float around in the air for many days. Smoke is a common term used for particulates large enough to be visible. Some of the organic compounds formed in the combustion process attach to these particulates, including some that are known to cause cancer. Coal contains trace amounts of nearly every element, including toxic metals like beryllium, arsenic, cadmium, selenium, and lead, and these are released in various forms as the coal burns.

All of the above pollutants are formed and released directly in the combustion process. Some time after their release, nitrogen oxides may combine with hydrocarbons in the presence of sunlight to form ozone, one of the most harmful pollutants. Or other compounds may form, such as PAN, which is best known as the cause of watering eyes in Los Angeles smog.

Let us summarize some of the known health effects of these pollutants:5

Sulfur dioxide is associated with many types of respiratory diseases, including coughs and colds, asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. Studies have found increased death rates from high sulfur dioxide levels among people with heart and lung diseases.
Nitrogen oxides can irritate the lungs, cause bronchitis and pneumonia, and lower resistance to respiratory infections such as influenza; at higher levels it can cause pulmonary edema.
Carbon monoxide bonds chemically to hemoglobin, the substance in the blood that carries oxygen to the cells, and thus reduces the amount of oxygen available to the body tissues. Carbon monoxide also weakens heart contractions, which further reduces oxygen supplies and can be fatal to people with heart disease. Even at low concentrations it can affect mental functioning, visual acuity, and alertness.
Particulates, when inhaled, can scratch or otherwise damage the respiratory system, causing acute and/or chronic respiratory illnesses. Depending on their chemical composition, they can contribute to other adverse health effects. For example, benzo-a-pyrene, well recognized as a cancer-causing agent from its effects in cigarette smoking, sticks to surfaces of particulates and enters the body when they are inhaled.
Hydrocarbons cause smog and are important in the formation of ozone.
Ozone irritates the eyes and the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. It affects lung function, reduces ability to exercise, causes chest pains, coughing, and pulmonary congestion, and damages the immune system.
Volatile organic compounds include many substances that are known or suspected to cause cancer. Prominent among these is a group called polycyclic aromatic, which includes benzo-a-pyrene mentioned above.
Toxic metals have a variety of harmful effects. Cadmium, arsenic, nickel, chromium, and beryllium can cause cancer, and each of these has additional harmful effects of its own. Lead causes neurological disorders such as seizures, mental retardation, and behavioral disorders, and it also contributes to high blood pressure and heart disease. Selenium and tellurium affect the respiratory system, causing death at higher concentrations.
It is well recognized that toxic substances acting in combination can have much more serious effects than each acting separately, but little is known in detail about this matter. Information on the quantities of air pollutants required to cause various effects is also very limited. However, there can be little doubt that air pollution is a killer.

The clearest evidence linking air pollution to increased mortality comes from several catastrophic episodes6 in which a large number of excess deaths occurred during times of high pollution levels, in all cases caused by coal burning in association with unfortunate weather conditions. In a December 1930 episode in the Meuse Valley of Belgium, there were 60 excess deaths and 6,000 illnesses. In an October 1948 episode in Donora, Pennsylvania, there were 20 deaths (versus 2 normally expected) in a 4-day period during which 6,000 of the 14,000 people in the valley became ill. There were at least eight episodes in London between 1948 and 1962 in each of which hundreds of excess deaths were recorded, the largest in December 1952 when 3,500 died. There were three episodes in New York City involving over a hundred deaths, one in November 1953 causing 360 deaths, another in January-February 1963 leading to 500 deaths, and a third in November 1966 resp"
"A few years ago, a young boy named Kevin Brown made national news after pollution from an industrial factory near his home triggered repeated asthma attacks. Kevin was going to emergency rooms week after week. His mother, Lana Brown, said, ""I would look outside and I would see him just leaning on a tree or leaning over a pole, gasping, gasping, trying to get some breath so he could go back to playing.” The Chicago neighborhood where Kevin grew up has some of the country’s most polluted air. Across the country many industrial facilities, including fossil fuel powered generators, are located in lower-income communities. Residents often seek help from activist groups and non-profit organizations to strengthen their voice and fight back against polluters, but these environmental justice groups are often under-resourced and can’t fight all the companies that poison low-income communities.  

Unfortunately, Kevin's case is not uncommon in low-income communities of color, specifically in Black and Latino neighborhoods where the asthma rate is extremely high. In the United States, asthma is the most prevalent chronic disease of childhood as it affects more than 6 million or 8.3% of the United States’ children. However, Black children are disproportionately affected compared to white children, as Black children are “79% more likely to live in neighborhoods where industrial pollution is suspected of posing the greatest health danger.”  

Impacts from fossil fuel plants are suspected contributing factors to higher mortality rates in these communities as they are more exposed to pollution. According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) report, “68% of African Americans live near a coal-fired power plant”. Latinos are also disproportionately exposed to these toxic chemicals. A 2016 report from the Clean Air Task Force states that “the air in many Latino communities violates air quality standards intended to protect human health” and Latino children are more likely to die from an asthma attack than white children.   

Fortunately, there are environmental justice solutions ready to be implemented to protect the planet and the most vulnerable communities burdened with fossil fuel effects. Let’s explore the problems, solutions, and how you can get involved.

How Fossil Fuels Damage Communities 
The combustion of fossil fuels releases fine particles and ground-level ozone, which are harmful pollutants. Carbon dioxide and other gases emitted in this process amplify the greenhouse effect and spur climate change. The combustion of oil and coal releases nitrogen oxides, sulfur and carbon as well as hydrocarbons, lead, soot and heavy minerals. Surface mining of coal through destructive practices (e.g. strip mining and mountaintop removal) is responsible for releasing toxic chemicals including heavy metals and arsenic. These chemicals pollute waterways, contaminating community groundwater.  As for natural gas extraction, and in particular fracking for natural gas, the chemicals used are hazardous, and are usually stored in open-air waste pits, releasing toxins in the air. These toxic chemicals affect human health causing not only physiological damages to the lungs, kidneys and blood streams but also damages to the brain as well.  

Particles from burning fossil fuels may exist in the air for several weeks at a time and can travel miles. When we breathe, toxic particles invade the lungs and get carried into the bloodstream. The World Health Organization estimates that worldwide 1.6 million people die from lung cancer each year. In the US, heart disease, stroke, cancer and respiratory illnesses are among the leading causes of deaths, and toxins released through the combustion of coal are directly linked to these diseases. A United Nations organization has calculated that global climate change is already the cause of 400,000 premature deaths every single year; recent reports show that pollution kills three times as many people as AIDs, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. These health risks extend from our heavy reliance on fossil fuels. In 2017, 31.8% of energy came from natural gas, 28% from petroleum and 17.8% from coal, whereas energy produced by renewable energy was only 12.7%. Major users of electricity like the telecoms sector should be purchasing and demanding clean energy sources.  

Powerlines set against a red sky

The Role of the Telecom Industry in Environmental Justice 
The burning of fossil fuels presents a significant environmental justice issue: harming public health and contributing to premature deaths in our country. Switching to renewable energies would decrease air pollution from energy sources and the risks associated with it.  In identifying sectors which lag in clean energy use, the telecommunications industry stands out as a large entity with significant influence on the climate with its use of over 3 million megawatt hours (MWh) of energy usage, mostly from fossil fuels. This industry emits 16 million tons of CO2 every year from its heavy reliance on dirty energy.  

AT&T and Verizon, the two leading US companies in the industry, have a combined electricity usage that could power 2.6 million homes for a year. Most of the sector’s energy use goes to maintain networks and data centers. The telecommunications industry relies heavily on these centers and access networks running 24/7 so we can stay connected. That connectivity comes at a high environmental and human health cost as data centers and networks serving the telecom industry are powered by fossil fuels.  

One of the effects of climate change is an increase of intensified storms that pose severe threat to human life and widespread devastation. Natural disasters leave in their wake destroyed communities and costly recovery efforts that are both labor and resource intensive. Telecom companies, particularly Verizon, call attention to the assistance they lend to impacted areas. These efforts are commendable, however when companies fail to take direct action to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions, they are neglecting the most impactful way they can curb climate change.  

Consumer interest and pressure urging these telecom giants to move to renewable energy sources is having an impact. In just the past year, T-Mobile committed to 100% renewable energy and AT&T has made commitments to purchase wind power that equal about 30% of its energy use.  But, Verizon, which is the largest player in the industry, only gets 2% of its energy from renewable sources, and is only committed to doubling that, to a paltry 4%, over the next few years.  And Sprint derives less than 1% of its energy from renewables. As the demand for energy from telecoms grows, they need to do more.  All telecom companies in the US need to commit to reaching 100% renewable energy by 2025. 

Environmental Justice: Pushing for Equitable Solutions  
The long-term consequences of pouring greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants into our atmosphere are dire, and there are also immediate impacts, which often afflict the poorest people worldwide. Studies have shown that the effects of climate change affect communities differently, and that minorities and marginalized groups are the most affected. The question of environmental justice then becomes that of the distribution (among individuals, social groups, countries) of the burdens related to environmental policies (risk prevention, changes in practices, restoration of degraded environments). Who will pay for the environmental degradation? and how? The burden is usually felt by the most vulnerable, known as ""frontline communities"". We could prevent 7,000 deaths a year caused by heart disease just by cutting pollution in communities of color to the same level of white neighborhoods. There are many climate justice organizations including Hip Hop Caucus, California Latino Water Coalition, Center of Race Poverty and the Environment, Indigenous Environmental Network, among others fighting daily for equal protection against climate change.  

Fossil fuel projects impact communities nationwide, including both “Red” and “Blue” states. This is a problem that cuts across political party lines. In 2016, the state of Maryland issued a permit for the construction of a new power plant in Brandywine, rural southern Prince George’s county, which is a majority Black community. The Panda Mattawoman power plant would be a new gas-fired power plant expected to increase the already high level of air pollution in the area, where a total of five power plants will be operating by 2019. According to the American Lung Association, Prince George’s county violates air quality standards, mostly due to the highly polluted air in Brandywine, where power plants are clustered. A coalition of environmental groups and activists are outraged by the state’s decision to permit another power plant to open near their homes. Residents of Brandywine filed a federal civil right complaint as they believe state legislators discriminate against their community, where 72% of residents are Black. Kamita Gray, president of the BTB Neighborhood Coalition stated, “we deserve a healthy quality of life, and we don’t deserve to be disproportionately and adversely impacted in our daily lives as it pertains to air quality, traffic and noise.”  

Legislators of Prince George’s county firmly believe that the new power plant will raise millions in tax revenues and will be economically beneficial for the state, ignoring the community's concerns altogether. The neighborhood coalition has taken action refusing to be the victims of another fossil fuel power plant’s hazard, and has partnered with Earthjustice to assess the impacts the project will have on their community. Most importantly, the power plants are clustered around an elementary school that suffers from the pollution and is surrounded by heavy black smoke. Brandywine’s residents count on the members of the BTB Neighborhood Coalition and nonprofits mainly because the town is not incorporated in Prince George's county and thus, doesn’t have a mayor to advocate for the issue. The situation in Brandywine caught the attention of Thriving Earth Exchange, a non-profit organization that has been helping Kamita Gray and the rest of the coalition collect scientific data on the town’ air quality. Without rigorous scientific data, the EPA and the state won’t consider even looking at the issue.  

Despite the hard work of Kamita Gray and the rest of the BTB Neighborhood Coalition and the help of these nonprofit organizations, lack of funding remains a major roadblock and the ongoing fight between the residents and the power plants is far from ending. Fred Tutman, the head of another nonprofit advocating for Brandywine, says this is an environmental injustice on a vulnerable community that lacks power, stating “by power I don't mean electricity, I mean political power. I mean economic power”. Community-led efforts to block or shut down polluting power plants result in varying outcomes. Unfortunately, these efforts are not always successful in blocking a plant however they can spur companies to retrofit facilities to limit pollutants. But, the health of vulnerable communities should not be compromised in order for us to keep watching our favorite movies or sharing memes.   

The fight over the Brandywine power plant is just one example of the many low-income communities nationwide that are  fighting the impacts of coal mining, gas fracking, power plants, and pipelines that threaten their air, water and lives.  These are the same communities that are often last to benefit from clean energy sources – such as solar and wind – and the well-paying jobs that come with clean energy.

"The world is on track for dangerous climate change, having nearly lost room for further pollution in the mix of gases that make up the atmosphere. Despite a rise in clean, renewable energy supplies in certain countries, and a partial shift from coal to natural gas in others, global greenhouse gas pollution continues to rise—and at an increasing pace in the most recent years.
 
""Economic and population growth are drivers for emissions and they have outpaced the improvements of energy efficiency,"" said Ottmar Edenhofer, economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and co-chair of Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Edenhofer spoke at an April 13 press conference in Berlin, where IPCC's Working Group III released its report on the subject of how to mitigate the climate problem.
 
Nations worldwide have to make major change in energy supply, soon, if they are to restrain climate change to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, Edenhofer and others said. That is a threshhold beyond which serious harm is likely to occur to human civilization as well as the natural world, by the IPCC and other's scientific judgment.
 
Geoengineering will probably also be required to solve the planet’s global warming pollution problem, Edenhofer and the report noted. The world will also need a crash course in technologies to capture carbon dioxide—the primary greenhouse gas— from the atmosphere to restrain global warming. Without such CCS hopes of restraining climate change to no more than 2 degrees C warming are ""no longer feasible,"" Edenhofer argued. ""In the end, two degrees means the phase out of fossil fuels without CCS entirely in the next few decades.""
 
Energy mix
Climate change is an energy problem. Burning fossil fuels to produce electricity or heat is responsible for roughly half of global warming pollution. Tacking on industry in general, including producing cement, steel, plastics and chemicals, accounts for 78 percent of greenhouse gases, which invisibly accumulate in the atmosphere and trap extra heat.  Such climate changing pollution continues to increase—in 2010, the world emitted some 49 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, thanks largely to increased coal burning in countries such as China. The number has continued to increase in recent years. In fact, human society added half of the global warming pollution that is in the atmosphere in just the last 40 years.
 
Restraining global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius will require changing how the world produces and uses energy to power its cities and factories, heats and cools buildings, as well as moves people and goods in airplanes, trains, cars, ships and trucks, according to the IPCC. Changes are required not just in technology, but also in people's behavior. ""We can reduce through substantial behavioral change and lifestyle change the demand for energy and the consumption of energy,"" noted Ramon Pichs-Madruga, economist at Cuba's Center for the Investigation of the Global Economy and co-chair of the Working Group III report. And that change ""allows for greater flexibility when we come to [choose] technology options. If we leave it all up to technology the costs and risks will be much greater.""
 
The initial IPCC report in this series, released last September, noted that the atmosphere could bear only 800 to 1,000 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, in order to restrain global warming to 2 degrees Celsius by century's end. The world has already emitted in total roughly 515 billion metric tons. At present rates of pollution then, human society would blow through its carbon budget in the next decade or so.
 
Such pollution has already doubled just since 1970 and the rates of pollution have been increasing by roughly 1 billion metric tons per year in recent years, a pace that must slow and stop soon. To hold global warming in check requires reducing current emission levels by as much as 70 percent by 2050, compared with 2010 levels, and nearly eliminating such pollution by 2100. Instead, ""over the last decade, we have seen increasing use of coal,"" the fossil fuel that when burned results in the most CO2, Edenhofer noted.
 
That pace of pollution now needs to slow and then reverse, likely requiring technologies that could pull CO2, the primary greenhouse gas, back out of the atmosphere. Such geoengineering could include technologies ranging from burning trees or grasses and capturing and storing the resulting CO2 from smokestacks to artificial trees that suck CO2 out of the sky directly for storage or re-use. ""This group of technologies is essential for low stabilization targets,"" Edenhofer said.
 
The problem is that none of this technology exists or, where it does as in the case of CCS, has not been deployed at a large enough scale, because it costs much more than the alternative: freely polluting the atmosphere. More aggressive geoengineering techniques—blocking sunlight and the like—remain too uncertain and fraught with risks to properly evaluate, this IPCC panel argued.
 
At the same time, emissions from traditional energy supplies must be zeroed out, either through CCS or replacement with less polluting energy sources, whether emissions-free wind and sun or lower carbon nuclear energy. Most of that change will have to take place in the developing world, whether replacing China's new coal-fired power plants or building wind, solar or geothermal facilities to power development in African countries. Fracking to free more natural gas from shale can help displace even more polluting coal in more developed countries such as the U.S. but can only serve as a bridge—and a very short bridge—to the zero-greenhouse-gas pollution future, unless also outfitted with carbon capture and storage to eliminate pollution. Fortunately, scientific surveys indicate that there is enough below-ground storage capacity in the Earth to accommodate humanity's swelling CO2 pollution.
 
Social change
All of this will also require a major change in investment, reducing money that continues to pour in to dig up fossil fuels by 20 percent per year (thus devaluing those deposits as well) and growing investment in, say, renewables by 100 percent per year. The cost of this transformation is not entirely clear. The IPCC suggests that the median estimate of paying for the change would take off 0.06 percent from global economic growth per year, a small part of a predicted minimum 1.6 percent annual growth globally, but still a restraint. ""It's a delay of economic growth but it is not sacrificing economic growth,"" Edenhofer noted, adding that this calculation does not take into account related benefits, such as a reduction in deadly air pollution and saved human lives, or salvaged nature. ""It does not cost the world to save the planet.""
 
Long-term climate stability would require ""unprecedented"" global cooperation, with countries agreeing to a plan that would set a global price on such pollution. As it stands, the countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have agreed to draft a global treaty by 2015, which would take effect in 2020. At the same time, the 1.3 billion people without access to electricity and the 3 billion or so who still rely on burning wood or dung to fuel cooking or heating would need modern energy supplies, although this might prove to have minimal impacts on climate change through saving forests and other side effects.
 
Without any action, the world is on track to achieve at least 4 degrees C warming of global average temperatures by 2100, as the world hits 450 parts-per-million of greenhouse gases in 2030 and goes on to put out enough greenhouse gas pollution to achieve as much as 1300 ppm by 2100. Even restraining warming to just 3 degrees C would require substantial transformation. ""What has to be done over the next 20 to 30 years or so does not change even if one relaxes the temperature target,"" Edenhofer said. ""Irrespective of the long-term mitigation goal, we have to start to bring the mitigation train onto the track.""
 
The IPCC suggests that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases should not exceed 450 ppm to meet nations' expressed aspiration to hold temperature rise to 2 degrees C or less. Already, atmospheric concentrations of just CO2 have reached 400 ppm at times and all greenhouse gases put together are now at 430 ppm. As a result, global average temperatures have already increased by 0.85 degree C. ""If we really want to bring about a limit of the temperature increase to no more than two degrees,"" said IPCC chair Rajendra Pachauri, ""the high-speed mitigation train would need to leave the station very soon and all of global society would need to get on board.""
 
The tracks that train would run on remain mostly unlaid and the exact route on the IPCC's map as presented here is not entirely clear. The route must go through the world's swelling cities, which provide the biggest opportunity to lock in pollution reductions, and the direction and speed—greenhouse gas pollution going down soon and fast—are apparent. This report ""provides hope, modest hope,"" Edenhofer said. ""We have the means to do this but it remains a huge, huge challenge."""
"Most greenhouse gases (GHGs) can be emitted by both natural processes and human activities. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, human-driven releases of GHG emissions disrupt the natural processes occurring in the atmosphere and are very likely to be the dominant cause of the observed warming that has occurred since the mid-20th century. Globally, almost 80% of GHG emissions from human sources come from the burning of fossil fuels and industrial processes. Specific activities include: driving vehicles, electricity production, heating and cooling of buildings, operation of appliances and equipment, production and transportation of goods, and provision of services and transportation for communities. In 2020, about 24% of Canada's total GHG emissions came from the oil and gas sector, 22% from transportation, 12% from buildings and 10% from the heavy industry sector.

Global GHG emissions grew by 24% between 2005 and 2019,Footnote1  with the bulk of the growth occurring in developing countries. During this period, Canada's share of total global GHG emissions remained at less than 2%, although it is one of the highest per capita emitters. In 2019, Canada’s GHG emissions per capita were 19.6 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2 eq),Footnote2  compared to 6.3 Mt CO2 eq globally.

GHGs have different global warming potentials and different lifespans in the atmosphere. Short-lived climate pollutants, such as methane (CH4) aand hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), are GHGs known to be very potent with relatively short lifespans. As such, emission reductions of short-lived climate pollutants can reduce atmospheric levels of these GHGs at a much quicker pace than comparable reductions from longer-lived GHGs. Therefore, immediate action to reduce these particular GHGs can have significant benefits for curbing near-term climate warming.

In 2015, Canada and 194 other countries reached the Paris Agreement which aims to limit the global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To achieve this long-term goal, the Paris Agreement requires countries to increase their ambition every 5 years. In 2021, Canada enhanced its initial target and commited to reducing its GHG emissions by 40 to 45% below 2005 levels by 2030. In addition, Canada has committed to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and adopted the Canadian Net?Zero Emissions Accountability Act in June 2021 to enshrine this commitment in federal legislation. By doing so, it will help to limit global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius.  

Key drivers of greenhouse gas emissions
A wide variety of factors have an influence on the level of GHG emissions in Canada. These include Canada's physical geography, demographic changes in its population and economic growth.

Canada has a highly variable climate. This contributes to relatively higher energy use for space heating and cooling in buildings, compared with other industrialized countries. While vast, Canada is also sparsely populated, which leads to longer travel times and higher demand for transportation than in smaller and/or more densely populated countries. In addition, Canada had the fastest population growth and its economy showed the second fastest growth among the G7 countries from 2005 to 2020.

Despite these challenges, over the past 2 decades, Canada has seen a decoupling between growth of the economy and GHG emissions. Over this period, technological improvements and regulations have been adopted and implemented in various economic sectors, particularly for electricity generation, to help reduce emissions.

Other important factors influencing GHG emissions include the adoption of more efficient practices and equipment by consumers and industry as their knowledge about their choices and the impacts of those choices on the environment is improving. Examples include how people commute to work, where businesses decide to locate their manufacturing facilities and the decisions made to increase the efficiency of industrial processes or to manufacture more energy-efficient products.

Key impacts of greenhouse gas emissions
The release of GHGs and their increasing concentration in the atmosphere are already having an impact on the environment, human health and the economy. These changes notably manifest in Canada's north, affecting many indigenous and remote communities. The impacts are expected to become more severe, unless united efforts to reduce emissions are undertaken.

Environmental impacts
Overall, average annual temperatures are expected to increase
Snow, sea ice and glacier coverage will decrease due to higher temperatures, resulting in rising sea levels and increased coastal flooding. Rising temperatures will also thaw permafrost in the Arctic
Future coastal-erosion rates will likely increase in most areas due to milder winters and smaller ice coverage
Overall precipitation levels are expected to increase across most of the country and during all seasons, except for parts of southern Canada where there are indications of an expected decrease in summer and fall precipitation
The increase in precipitation is expected to be combined with more frequent heavy precipitation events, resulting in higher risks of flooding
Heat waves are likely to increase in frequency and severity, resulting in higher risks of forest fires
Many wildlife species will have difficulty adapting to a warmer climate and will likely be subject to greater stress from diseases and invasive species
Human health impacts
Higher temperatures and more frequent and severe extreme weather events may increase the risk of deaths from dehydration and heat stroke, and of injuries from intense local weather changes
There may be a greater risk of respiratory and cardiovascular problems and certain types of cancers, as temperatures rise and exacerbate air pollution
The risk of water-, food-, vector- and rodent-borne diseases may increase
Mental health can be affected by concerns associated with climate change and its impacts  or by the traumas from short-term (extreme weather events) and long term climate-related hazards (drought, sea-level rise, thawing permafrost)
People living in Canada's northern communities, and vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly, are expected to be the most affected by the changes
Economic impacts
Agriculture, forestry, tourism and recreation may be affected by changing weather patterns
Human health impacts are expected to place additional economic stress on health and social support systems
Damage to infrastructure (for example, roads and bridges) caused by extreme weather events, thawing permafrost and rising sea levels is expected to increase, impacting local populations and resource development
Ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
Addressing climate change requires action from everyone across all nations. Governments, businesses and individuals need to take significant steps to reduce emissions by using resources more efficiently and adopting new and cleaner technologies.

Governments
In 2016, Canada released the first-ever national climate plan – the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change – jointly developed by the federal, provincial and territorial governments. The plan includes a pan-Canadian approach to pricing carbon pollution, and measures to achieve emissions reductions across all sectors of the economy. It also aims to drive innovation and growth; increase technology development and adoption to ensure Canadian businesses are competitive in the global low-carbon economy. The measures in the Pan-Canadian Framework sets in place Canada's foundation for reaching its 2030 and 2050 targets.

In December 2020, the Government of Canada released its strengthened climate plan, A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy, which builds on the measures included in the Pan-Canadian Framework. The plan contains 64 strengthened and new federal policies, programs and investments to cut pollution and build a stronger, cleaner, more resilient and inclusive economy. Also as part of the plan, the Government of Canada committed to develop Canada’s first National Adaptation Strategy.

In March 2022, the Government of Canada published the 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan under the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which continues to build upon the actions outlined in Canada's previous climate plans. This plan is a roadmap that outlines a sector-by-sector measures and strategies  for Canada to reach its emissions reduction target of 40-45% below 2005 levels by 2030 and put in the place the building blocks to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The plan will be reviewed and updated in progress reports produced in 2023, 2025 and 2027. Additional targets will be developed in 5-year intervals for 2035 through to 2045, as well as associated plans through to 2050.

Implementing the Pan-Canadian Framework and the strengthened climate plan, and releasing a National Adaptation Strategy are key actions or milestones noted in the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy. The Strategy sets out the Government of Canada's sustainable development priorities, establishes goals and targets, and identifies actions to achieve them. The 2022-2026 Strategy, Canada's fifth, outlines the actions toward sustainability that the Government will take in collaboration with partners within Canada and internationally. As such, it supports the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its global sustainable development goals (SDGs).

To learn about the expected impact of GHG emission regulations developed by the government of Canada, consult the Regulatory Impact Analysis StatementFootnote3  (also known as a RIAS) which accompanies each regulation. The RIAS outlines the reasons behind the development of a particular regulation, its objectives and its expected costs and benefits. The RIAS also includes details about consultations that were conducted and about how the government intends to track the performance of the regulation.

Businesses
Companies are increasingly integrating the need to reduce GHG emissions and carbon pricing considerations into their investment, planning, and operational decisions in order to improve their long-term resilience and competitiveness. Through their actions and investments, companies can also support the transition to a low-carbon economy. For example, nearly 40 Canadian companies contribute to the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, a voluntary initiative that supports and encourages successful implementation of carbon pricing around the world.

Private sector capital and expertise will be needed to contribute to Canada’s climate objectives and create a climate-resilient economy. Supported by the recent launch of the Sustainable Finance Action Council, the Canadian financial sector is working towards integrating sustainable finance into standard industry practice. Sustainable finance refers to the incorporation of climate and environmental considerations throughout financial decision making. In turn, this enables the mobilization and alignment of private sector investments towards climate and environmental objectives.

Individuals
Individuals can reduce GHG emissions at home, at work and in everyday activities. We can make a difference by changing our behaviour and making lifestyle decisions that reduce emissions. For more information on how individual Canadians can help our environment, including by reducing GHG emissions, consult Things you can do to improve climate change and the environment on the Government of Canada's Climate change website."
"This summer, Earth experienced record-breaking high temperatures. As humanity suffers from dehydration and heatstroke, researchers seek sustainable solutions. A significant contributing factor to climate change is greenhouse gas emissions.

Emissons are just one of the effects of fossil fuels on the environment. Fortunately, President Biden recognized the ecological challenge and generated restrictions. He plans on developing a carbon-neutral nation in the coming decades.

The Enhanced Greenhouse Effect
Fossil fuels power the world. Our electricity production, transportation sector, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems all require the conventional fuel source. During combustion, fossil fuels generate greenhouse gas emissions.

When the emissions pollute the atmosphere, they alter Earth’s natural temperature control process. Organically, when solar radiation reaches the atmosphere, it generates heat. Earth uses the energy to warm the surface, creating a life-sufficient environment.

After the surface reaches an appropriate temperature, the atmosphere re-absorbs excess energy and converts it to more heat. Once Earth attains an adequate heat rate, it emits unnecessary energy to space, preserving the environment. When greenhouse gases reach the atmosphere, they create an altered chemical state.



The pollutants have a higher sunlight-to-heat conversion rate than conventional atmospheric elements. They also trap excess heat in the environment rather than emitting it to space. The overproduction and entrapment of warmth raise the global temperature over time.

Evaporation and Water Displacement
The enhanced greenhouse effects cause a ripple impact of destruction. One degrading ecological influence of rising greenhouse gas emissions is a heightened evaporation rate. As global temperatures rise, heat depletes local water sources, leaving reservoirs, rivers and lakes dry.

The increased evaporation rate also causes water displacement. As some regions become ridden with elongated drought periods, others experience increased precipitation. The displacement of water sources causes industrial changes in the agricultural industry.

In the U.S., Southern California develops the majority of our nationally grown produce supply. Until recently, it was the optimal location for agricultural production because of consistently warm temperatures and water supplies. Now, California struggles to attain adequate resources.

The drought places immense stress on farmers, decreasing their yield sizes. Soon, the agricultural industry will have to relocate, residing in a location with plentiful water sources. If greenhouse gas emissions continue exploiting the atmosphere, we may run out of adequate land for food production.

Surface Pollution
The fossil fuel industry also generates ecological degradation in the oil and gas sector. Unmaintained pipelines cause fuel leaks, creating surface pollution. When the lines erode, they may release nearly 85% of their materials into the local ecosystem.  

More than half of pipeline explosions cause soil toxicity, generating adverse human health effects. They additionally generate species endangerment when impacting their habitats. In agricultural regions, a leak or explosion can destroy the food supply.

Until recently, America had an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established act protecting against surface pollution. The Clean Power Plan could prevent pollution generated by the fossil fuel industry, converting our energy reliance towards the renewable power sector. Unfortunately, the Trump administration abolished the act, leaving natural lands unprotected.

The failed government regulation and maintenance led to the explosion in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. A corroding pipeline was unstable when a landslide occurred, fueling a destructive blast. Various residents lost their homes, vehicles and agricultural resources because of the explosion.

Powering Change
Since the Paris Agreement’s establishment in 2015, environmental scientists and engineers began developing accessible green technology. They targeted fossil fuel-driven emissions with renewable energy sources. Generating zero-emission technology decreases the enhanced greenhouse effect and preserves the climate.

Tesla released the first accessible electric vehicle on the market, supporting alternative transportation methods. Unlike conventional automobiles, you can charge the car using clean energy derived from wind and solar power. They also generate zero tailpipe emissions, creating a significantly smaller carbon footprint.

Developing an electric grid can also reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. A large portion of our emissions derive from the energy sector. With an electric grid, we can source our electricity from renewable power.

One current model shows promising potential for an industrial-scale grid. In Monterey, California, the Vistra energy company developed a renewable energy storage facility, delivering clean electricity to residents. The location stores a 1,200 megawatt-hour battery back, containing and producing energy for extended use.

America can utilize the technology, generating a mass storage system, supporting an electric grid. The system would help us reach Biden’s carbon neutrality goal. We can also increase production while preserving water sources using floatovoltic panels.

Traditionally, solar panels mount onto rooftops or in fields. Scientists evaluated their conventional uses as efficiency degrading and resource depleting. They decreased the limitations by developing floating solar panels.

The panels cover canals, reservoirs, lakes and the ocean, shielding the water from solar radiation. Sunlight enhances the evaporation effect, and professionals use the panels to shade water sources. They simultaneously create clean energy, fueling local residential and commercial buildings."
"ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING
Fossil fuels — coal, petroleum, and natural gas — are our main sources of energy, producing the vast majority of fuel, electricity, and heat used by people across the globe. In 2005 a whopping 86 percent of energy used worldwide came from fossil fuel combustion, and right now in the United States, the number isn’t much lower at about 85 percent. Unfortunately fossil fuels are also the primary culprit behind climate change. In the United States, they’re to blame for more than 80 percent of greenhouse gas emissions — and 98 percent of CO2 emissions alone. And while natural processes can absorb some of this CO2, an estimated 4.1 billion metric tons of it is added to our atmosphere each year. That number will rise dramatically if we don’t check ourselves.

Still, the Bush administration continued to tout fossil fuels over all other energy sources, supporting ridiculously low fuel economy standards, more oil drilling, new natural gas pipelines, oil shale development, coal-fired power plants and coal mining, and other projects that drive global warming and harm species and habitat. To reverse this trend, besides opposing unsustainable energy production — while supporting renewable energy that doesn’t hurt the climate or species — the Center has made use of the legal tools at hand to force the administration and energy industry to keep climate change on the agenda. By showing that existing laws already call for limits on greenhouse gas emissions, monitoring and mitigation for greenhouse gas-spewing energy projects, and the use of alternative fuel sources and technologies, the Center’s Climate Law Institute aims to make sure that addressing global warming becomes a standard part of environmental analysis for all things energy.

COAL: THE WORST OF THE WORST
Because of its high carbon content, coal emits more CO2 than any other fossil fuel when it’s burned. It’s also the main source of fuel for electricity worldwide, and in the United States it accounts for 83 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the electric power sector. It makes sense, then, that coal combustion worldwide is the number-one contributor to the human-made increase of CO2 in the atmosphere. Making matters worse, coal mining produces methane, a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 25 times greater than that of CO2 on a 100-year timeline.

Emissions from coal-fired power plants represent one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases (sharing the top spot with vehicle emissions). Happily, existing laws including the Clean Air Act, Endangered Species Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and others already regulate those emissions if only they were enforced; and we’re working hard to enforce them. After the Environmental Protection Agency illegally approved a permit for a massive proposed coal-fired power plant in New Mexico without complying with the Endangered Species Act, in September 2008 the Center appealed the approval — and in spring 2009, the agency requested the voluntary rejection of the permit. In January 2009, we filed an appeal to stop the White Pine project, a proposed coal-fired power plant in Nevada that would be one of the largest and most heavily polluting coal plants in the western United States. The same year, in response to a petition by the Center and allies, Kentucky’s controversial TVA “Paradise” coal-fired power plant was sent back to the drawing board to redo its operating permit.

PETROLEUM AND THE TRANSPORTATION CRISIS
Burning petroleum emits about three-fourths as much CO2 as burning coal, and thanks to oil’s role as the established fuel for transportation globally, it’s neck-and-neck with coal in the race to become the leading greenhouse gas producer. On top of the enormous amounts of CO2 churned out when petroleum is burned as gas by cars and trucks, hundreds of millions of tons of the pollutant are emitted in the oil-refining process. And before oil even hits the plants, oil exploration and drilling can have a devastating effect on imperiled species, including the ribbon seal, the California condor — and, of course, the polar bear.

Nontraditionally produced petroleum products, like oil extracted from oil shale and tar sands, can have lifecycle emissions even worse than coal. Shale mining is the dirtiest method of producing energy, requiring many energy-intensive steps, complex extraction and production methods, and a lot of waste. Compared to crude oil, every barrel of shale oil sends 50 percent more CO2 into the atmosphere, and oil shale development requires more land than conventional oil and more water than farming in the desert. Tar sands development is also dirty and wasteful: About two tons of tar sands and several barrels of water are required to produce a single barrel of oil, and the mining and extraction processes require large amounts of energy and emit far more greenhouse gases than the conventional oil production method. There’s been no significant production of U.S. oil shale for at least 30 years — for a good reason: It just doesn’t make sense. Our world’s climate and our nation’s lands simply can’t afford oil shale and tar sands development in the United States.

The Center has confronted the oil and gas industry through a variety of approaches, from pushing for full enforcement of laws to limiting vehicles’ greenhouse gas emissions to directly challenging oil development in endangered species habitat. We’re also actively opposing oil shale and tar sands development by submitting comments, generating media, and rallying public support for a “no action” alternative to the Bureau of Land Management’s commercial oil shale and tar sands leasing program, proposed for 2 million acres of public lands in the American West.

NATURAL GAS: NOT AS “CLEAN” AS IT PRETENDS
Natural gas, which in general emits about half the CO2 of coal when burned, is often dubbed the “cleanest” of the fossil fuel triumvirate. However, in absolute terms it’s still a huge contributor to global warming-causing emissions, and its contribution is expected to grow.

The production of liquefied natural gas, or LNG — natural gas that’s been “supercooled” and converted to liquid for ease of storage or transport — in fact does extreme damage to our climate. Because of the tremendous energy required to liquefy, transport, and “regassify” LNG, LNG processing from just one plant can generate more than 24 million tons of greenhouse gases per year, equal to the annual greenhouse gas pollution from about 4.4 million cars; researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have concluded that LNG can actually produce almost as much greenhouse gas pollution as coal. Making matters worse, tanker ship traffic and facilities for LNG threaten directly harm wildlife, threatening delicate marine and estuarine species — from endangered whales to threatened salmon — as well as land-dwelling species, including the endangered El Segundo blue butterfly, whose last habitat near Los Angeles is jeopardized by pipelines from a proposed LNG facility called OceanWay.

The Center has taken an active stance against liquefied natural gas production, stepping in to fight destructive LNG projects from Los Angeles’s OceanWay to an abandoned Chevron proposal for a Baja California LNG terminal that would have devastated habitat for endangered seabirds. We’ve also intervened to force the California Energy Commission to consider greenhouse gas emissions for the Carlsbad Energy Center Project, a proposed power plant for San Diego County that would rely on liquefied natural gas as a fossil fuel."
"If you have been following conversations around climate change, you probably are familiar with a few key points: 

Climate impacts — droughts, floods, fires, severe storms — are worsening at an alarming rate, and are hitting the most vulnerable people, communities, and countries the hardest — which will be reiterated on February 28 with the IPCC’s WGII Sixth Assessment Report.
It’s urgent that we act now to reduce these impacts, before they get much, much worse. 
Fossil fuels — oil, gas and coal — are the primary source of climate pollution — contributing 94 percent of carbon dioxide emissions and nearly three-quarters of climate changing emissions.
Starting from these points, I’d like to cover: 

How entrenched fossil fuel industry interests have slowed progress in addressing climate change.
That even though there is a very long way to go and a very short time to address the climate crisis, there is now important momentum and hope.
That there are now clear, timely opportunities for governments to act to phase out fossil fuels, particularly oil and gas, in a just and equitable way. 
We – and the fossil fuel industry – have known that fossil fuels cause climate change for a long time. 

As early as 1959, at an energy symposium organized by the American Petroleum Institute, a prominent physicist presented on the impacts of burning fossil fuels, saying carbon dioxide “causes a greenhouse effect” and “a temperature rise corresponding to a 10 percent increase in carbon dioxide will be sufficient to melt the ice cap and submerge New York…”

That was over 60 years ago.

Additionally, even though international climate negotiations began 30 years ago, the amount of fossil fuels as a percentage of the global energy supply has not changed. In 1992, the year the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was established, fossil fuels were 80.7% of the global energy supply. As of 2019, in spite of extremely rapid growth and adoption of renewable energy, fossil fuels are still 80.9% of the global energy supply.

How can we have known for 60 years that fossil fuels are the central driver of climate change, and been negotiating international climate action for 30 years, but still not made significant progress on phasing out fossil fuels?

We have seen time and again how the fossil fuel industry has operated to maximize profits without regard to environmental or human rights impacts of its operations, and it has specifically obstructed action on climate change. This is a major force in delaying climate efforts. 

Oil and gas companies now claim to be part of the solution, regularly making climate plans and commitments. But none of the current plans of any of the largest integrated oil and gas companies come close to aligning with the goals of the Paris Agreement to hold global warming to 1.5 degrees. This is greenwash, further delaying necessary action.

The industry and its backers continue to perpetuate myths about fossil fuel phase out. For instance: 

They say phasing out fossil fuels will cost jobs. This is not the case. Clean energy creates more jobs on average than fossil fuel energy, and can be scaled up as fossil fuels are phased out, expanding the total number of energy jobs.
They say gas is needed as a bridge to clean energy. Wrong. Gas breaks the carbon budget and is not needed for grid reliability. Wind and solar are already the cheapest forms of bulk energy supply in most major markets.
They say fossil fuels are needed for development. No. Distributed renewable energy is the cheapest and most efficient way to increase energy access. And oil and gas production in many countries is geared towards export, not reinforcing or providing energy resources to local economies.
Instead of favoring industry messages, governments should listen to underrepresented voices, women, young people, those from impacted communities, and civil society working to amplify these voices. Those who face higher risks and greater burdens from the impacts of climate change and of fossil fuel development need to be heard and valued in these conversations in order to create just and effective solutions. 

Governments must act to curb the power of the industry and take action to phase out fossil fuels because, quite simply, if we don’t phase out fossil fuels, we will not solve the climate crisis.

Despite the enormity of the change we need to make, there is momentum and hope. For the last two decades, I have worked at the intersections of environment, development, and human rights. In particular, I have focused on actions that governments and institutions must take to address the root causes and impacts of environmental pollution and climate change.

When I started this work, phasing out oil and gas did not feature in climate policy discussions at all. Now, the increased recognition from governments, institutions, and even parts of the financial sector of the role of fossil fuels in climate change represents a sea change from where we were even just a few years ago.

Last year, following years of pressure from civil society groups and others, the International Energy Agency (IEA) came out with the finding that oil and gas in already-producing or under-development fields will be sufficient to meet demand in a world that limits warming to 1.5ºC. This Net Zero scenario is now incorporated in the World Energy Outlook, a publication widely used for making global energy decisions.

We also saw significant progress on the sidelines of COP 26 in Glasgow: 

The governments of Costa Rica and Denmark officially launched the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA), establishing the world’s first diplomatic initiative focused on keeping oil and gas in the ground. BOGA brings together countries and jurisdictions that have ended licensing for new oil and gas exploration and production and are setting an end date for their production.
Additionally, nearly 40 countries and institutions launched a joint commitment to end international public finance for fossil fuels by the end of 2022 and instead prioritize public finance for clean energy. This commitment could directly shift at least USD 24.1 billion a year in public finance out of fossil fuels and into clean energy, based on OCI data from 2018-2020, which will help shift even larger flows of private finance.
This shift in framing and focus around climate change presents significant opportunities, and begins to chart a pathway that governments can take towards addressing fossil fuels’ role in climate change.

Those of us who care about climate, development, human rights, and inequality, and particularly, those of us with the power to act, must use these opportunities and this momentum to continue to change the narrative, offer pathways for change, and describe and adopt the steps necessary for a truly just transition.

Governments can act now to:

Adopt policies to phase out exploration for and production of fossil fuels. 
Commit to end public finance and subsidies for fossil fuels.
Support communities and workers that need help to make a just transition to clean energy.
At the international level, cooperate to support countries that will need help to make this transition, as well as support in adapting to climate impacts we are already seeing.
Continue expanding the conversation around energy and climate change to include more voices, working not just to address climate change but also to reverse the systems of inequity that are driving this crisis. "
"The problem with non-renewable energies
Let's start with a significant fact - in just one year, humans consume what nature has taken millions of years to produce. This is the case with fossil fuels, for example. It takes thousands or millions of years for them to form, and in a few short decades we will have exhausted all the reserves of these energy sources.

“It is essential that 60 % of the oil still available, as well as 90 % of the coal, remain underground”

Coal, oil and natural gas are known as non-renewable sources of energy because they exist in limited quantities in nature. In other words, they are generated from finite resources or they take an extremely long time to regenerate.

Nuclear energy is also a non-renewable energy source because the uranium it uses as fuel does not regenerate on its own. Nevertheless, it does help to fight against climate change, because it does not emit CO2 or greenhouse gases.

 

Environmental impact of non-renewable energies
These resources are found in nature, but they disappear as they are used. According to a recent study published in the scientific journal Nature, oil reserves will be depleted by 2043. The same applies to coal and natural gas - the date when we will no longer have these fossil fuels is fast approaching. But the reason why we must urgently seek new sources of energy is not because these resources are running out, but because of the serious environmental impact of non-renewable energies on our planet.

 

 

The fuel of climate change ????
Fossil fuels account for 80 % of current global demand for primary energy, and the energy system is the source of approximately two-thirds of worldwide CO? emissions.

Both CO? and other greenhouse gases are able to accumulate and emit heat. And, as the experts have shown, an increase in the concentration of CO? in the atmosphere leads to a significant increase in the Earth's temperature. Today, the Earth's temperature has already increased by over 1°C since the pre-industrial era. You can read more about it here.

“Fossil fuels account for 80 % of current global demand for primary energy”

If current trends continue – i.e. if the current share of fossil fuels is maintained and the forecast that energy demand will double by 2050 proves to be correct – we will be a long way from keeping the global temperature rise to 2°C, never mind 1.5°C. Such warming would have disastrous consequences for the planet and its climate.

 

Oil slicks and spills ???
Furthermore, on the list of environmental disasters resulting from human activities, oil slicks are among the most serious and also the most common. One of the most affected areas on the planet is the Amazon.

Having been affected since 2014 by frequent oil spills, nearly 400 communities in the Peruvian Amazon have lead, cadmium, mercury and other heavy metals in their system.

The province of Sucumbíos, part of the Ecuadorian Amazon, is one of the areas most affected by oil pollution. Food, water and air are affected by spills. The rainforest is full of mecheros, huge chimneys that burn the exhaust gases from oil extraction and also pollute rainwater, the primary source of water for the area's inhabitants.

 

Radioactive waste ??
Where nuclear energy is concerned, it is necessary to handle radioactive waste correctly. This is waste that cannot be recycled and must be stored very safely because it can generate radioactivity for centuries and even millennia. Nuclear waste has to be managed by ensuring maximum safety, as radioactivity is harmful to the health of people and the planet. Radioactivity released in large quantities is lethal and can also cause deformities and disease in people living in the area over several generations.

You only have to listen to the stories of those who, decades later, are still suffering the effects of the Chernobyl nuclear accident.



 

Acid rain ????
Acid rain is one of the consequences of air pollution. It happens when pollutant emissions from factories, cars or central heating boilers come into contact with atmospheric humidity. These emissions are caused by the burning of fossil fuels, and lead to the acidification of soils, lakes and seas with the resulting damage to land and marine flora and fauna.

 

Effects on human health ????
The fact is that all the consequences of using non-renewable energies mentioned above have an impact on people's health in one way or another. But, looking at more specific data, air pollution from burning fossil fuels causes 4.5 million deaths worldwide each year, according to a study by Greenpeace and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Not to mention that, according to WHO estimates, about 4.2 million premature deaths occur annually from exposure to metal particles linked to burning fossil fuels.

 

Energy transition: the route towards renewables
Fortunately, all of these impacts can be prevented, lessened and even reversed. How? By firmly committing to renewables and supporting a definitive transition to clean and inexhaustible sources of energy. We are talking about wind energy, photovoltaic solar energy, solar thermal energy, hydraulic energy and so on.

According to the Nature study mentioned at the beginning of this article, if we do not stop using non-renewable energies immediately, the temperature rise that awaits us will bring irreversible changes to our planet - more heat waves, longer warm seasons, shorter cold seasons, a surge in the most extreme weather events etc.

The energy transition is the only way forward if we want to achieve the most ambitious objective of the Paris Agreement: to limit the rise in the temperature of the planet to 1.5°C above pre-industrial values, which according to the IPCC would mean that carbon neutrality can be achieved by 2050. Effort is required on the part of all countries to create a global energy system that is stable, sustainable and affordable. A world that functions on the basis of renewable energies is critical to guarantee our future and that of the planet."
"Natural gas vs. Coal – a positive impact on the environment
Global energy demand is growing. Energy needs rise more slowly than in the past but still are expected to expand by 30% between today and 2040. This is the equivalent of adding another China and India to today’s global demand. A global economy growing at an average rate of 3.4% per year, a population that expands from 7.4 billion today to more than 9 billion in 2040, and a process of urbanisation that adds a city the size of Shanghai to the world’s urban population every four months are key forces that underpin International Energy Agency projections.

All this puts a lot of pressure on our planet’s ecosystem. The current levels of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are unprecedented in the last 800,000 years.

The energy generation sector (electrical and heat) is the largest source of GHGs, accounting for more than 60% of all GHG emissions (electricity production – 28.4%; industry – 22%; commercial and residential – 11%) which primarily come from burning fossil fuels for energy (source: Report by the US Environmental Protection Agency – EPA).

The role that natural gas can play in the future of global energy is inextricably linked to its ability to help address environmental problems. With concerns about air quality and climate change looming large, natural gas offers many potential benefits if it displaces more polluting fuels. This is especially true given limits to how quickly renewable energy options can be scaled up and that cost-effective zero-carbon options can be harder to find in some parts of the energy system. The flexibility that natural gas brings to an energy system can also make it a good fit for the rise of variable renewables such as wind and solar PV.

Natural gas is a fossil fuel, though the global warming emissions from its combustion are much lower than those from coal or oil. Natural gas emits 50 to 60 percent less carbon dioxide (CO2) when combusted in a new, efficient natural gas-power plant compared with emissions from a typical new coal plant.

The amount of CO2 produced when a fuel is burned is a function of the carbon content of the fuel. The heat content, or the amount of energy produced when a fuel is burned, is mainly determined by the carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) content of the fuel. Heat is produced when C and H combine with oxygen (O) during combustion. Natural gas is primarily methane (CH4), which has a higher energy content relative to other fuels, and thus, it has a relatively lower CO2-to-energy content. Water and various other elements, such as sulfur and noncombustible elements in some fuels, reduce their heating values and increase their CO2-to-heat contents. That’s the reason why different fuels emit different amounts of CO2 in relation to the energy they produce when burned.

Coal (anthracite)	228.6
Coal (bituminous)	205.7
Diesel fuel and heating oil	161.3
Gasoline (without ethanol)	157.2
Propane	139.0
Natural gas	117.0

Coal-fired plants emit not only carbon dioxide. There are also other toxins that have an immediate and direct impact on people’s health such as mercury. Avoiding coal burning would save hundreds million $ a year in health-care costs by avoiding illnesses caused by pollutants, such as asthma attacks, heart attacks and deaths linked to the coal-fired plants’ emissions.

Cleaner burning than other fossil fuels, the combustion of natural gas produces negligible amounts of sulfur, mercury, and particulates. In transportation, burning natural gas does produce some nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are precursors to smog, but at much lower levels than gasoline and diesel used for motor vehicles. Analyses by the US Department of Energy indicate that every 10,000 U.S. homes powered with natural gas instead of coal avoid the annual emissions of 1,900 tons of NOx, 3,900 tons of SO2, and 5,200 tons of particulates. Reductions in these emissions translate into public health benefits, as these pollutants have been linked to problems such as asthma, bronchitis, lung cancer, and heart disease for hundreds of thousands of people.

Each fossil fuel has a different life cycle. The extraction/production; refining/conditioning; transportation/storage; and combustion of each fossil fuel is different. And, each fossil fuel contributes greenhouse gases at different stages of its life cycle. Likewise, at different stages, every fossil fuel contributes to global warming to a different degree.

The total environmental impact of coal is greater than that of any other fossil fuel. Especially with respect to open-pit coal mining, the environmental impact of coal cannot be overstated. From the destruction of forests, devastation of water quality, and the irreversible changing of landscape, coal mining has a massive impact on the environment.

With respect to carbon emissions, coal mining and the burning of coal account for a greater sum than any other fuel.

Coal, unlike gas fuels and oil, does not emit carbons into the air in its natural state. However, during the mining of coal, methane is released into the air. Tremendous amounts of methane (CH4) are released into the air in fact. Each year, in the U.S. alone, coal mining releases an estimated 61 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTC02E) tons of methane into the air.

Coal combustion produces more greenhouse gases than the combustion of any other fossil fuel. There are a handful of coal types, but almost all contribute substantially more CO2 into the air than other fossil fuels upon combustion.

We have to mention that there is a lot of methane released into the atmosphere during oil and natural gas production too. Therefore, the technology developed by the GASVESSEL project that allows utilizing natural gas currently burned or released into the air is contributing to global GHG reduction efforts."
"A new study highlights that the global fossil fuel production should decline by 3% per year until 2050 to keep global warming to below 1.5°C[Paris Agreement goal].
What are fossil fuels?

Coal, crude oil, and natural gas are all considered fossil fuels.
They were formed from the fossilized, buried remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago.
Because of their origins, fossil fuels have a high carbon content.
Fossil fuels produce large quantities of carbon dioxide when burned. Carbon emissions trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and eventually to climate change.

What is the Paris climate goal?

It aims to make efforts to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C [an ambitious 1.5°C] above pre-industrial levels (1850-1900).
As of now (2021), human activities have already caused global temperatures to rise by about 1°C above pre-industrial levels.
Currently, countries’ emissions targets are not in line with limiting global warming to under 1.5°C.
How is the current level of fossil fuel extraction?

As of now, both planned and operational fossil fuel extraction projects are not conducive to meeting the Paris Agreement targets.
Globally, production of fossil fuels needed to have peaked in 2020 and be on a steady decline of 3% every year until 2050.
A substantial number of regions in the world have already reached their peak fossil fuel production.
Any increase hereafter will have to be offset by a decline elsewhere, to stick to the tight carbon budget.
To achieve the targets, almost 60% of oil and gas reserves and 90% of coal must remain unextractedby 2050.

Specifically, unextractable estimates for coal show less regional variation, although they are lowest in those regions that utilize most coal in the next 30 years.[Notably India, China and other parts of Asia.]
Greenpeace report published in early 2020

In 2020, global cost of air pollution from fossil fuels was around $2.9 trillion per year, or $8 billion per day, which was 3.3% of the world’s GDP.
Of this, India is estimated to bear a cost of $150 billion from air pollution caused by fossil fuels.
IPCC warns that fossil fuel emissions must be halved within 11 years (from 2021) if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.



Why are unextracted reserves important?

A carbon budget is the cumulative amount of CO2 that can be released in a time period keeping with the Paris goals.
But this does not consider uncertainties around, say, climate-system feedbacks.
So, to ensure more certainty of stabilising at this temperature, even more carbon needs to stay in the ground.
In other words, there is much less room for fossil fuels to be extracted than previously estimated.
What does this call for?

Bold national policies to entirely phase out fossil-fuel extraction.
Stopping issuing fossil-fuel exploration permits.
Move away from reliance on fossil fuels to renewables.

"The combustion of fossil fuels is by far the largest human source of global greenhouse gas emissions, releasing more than 30 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere each year (IPCC 2014). Reducing fossil fuel combustion is thus a top priority for climate policy. For decades, national policymakers and international agreements have sought to achieve this goal through promoting energy efficiency, low-carbon technologies, carbon pricing, and other measures aimed at reducing the demand for fossil fuels. Focusing on the point of combustion makes intuitive sense, but efforts so far have yet to put fossil fuel use on a trajectory consistent with keeping global warming well below 2 °C and pursuing efforts to stay below 1.5 °C, as suggested by the Paris Agreement.

Recognizing this shortcoming, policymakers, investors, researchers, and civil society actors have begun to look at the supply side of the fossil fuel economy—and the potential for supply-side measures to complement demand-side climate policies. A key insight driving these new approaches is that the political and economic interests and institutions that underpin fossil fuel production help to perpetuate fossil fuel use and even to increase it. From this emerging vantage point, continued investment in fossil fuel exploration, extraction, and delivery infrastructure makes global climate protection objectives much harder to achieve.

The focus on fossil fuel supply in climate policy has high-profile proponents. OECD Secretary-General Ángel Gurría has emphasized the challenge posed by decades of investment in fossil fuel supply and the “carbon entanglement” it creates, as governments depend on the profits they accrue (Gurría 2013). And during his final 18 months, US president Barack Obama took steps to begin constraining the expansion of fossil fuel production on climate grounds—the rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, making the Arctic and Atlantic off-limits to further exploration and drilling and initiating a programmatic review of coal leasing policies (White House CEQ 2014; The White House 2015, 2016).

The intersection of climate policy and fossil fuel production is also the subject of a growing body of research (Harstad 2012; Asheim 2012; Hoel 2013; Collier and Venables 2014; Lazarus et al. 2015; Gerarden et al. 2016; Muttitt et al. 2016; Fæhn et al. 2017; Day and Day 2017; Eichner and Pethig 2017). Studies have examined, for example, the extent to which achieving climate protection objectives would dramatically curtail fossil fuel profits, or “rents” (Bauer et al. 2013), and render a significant fraction of coal and unconventional oil reserves and resources “unburnable” (McGlade and Ekins 2015; Bauer et al. 2015). Researchers and financial advisory institutions have also highlighted the risk that climate and broader environmental concerns might lead to the premature retirement of fossil fuel reserves and supply infrastructures—and thus result in “stranded assets” and associated financial losses for investors and governments (Leaton et al. 2013; HSBC Global Research 2013; Caldecott et al. 2013; Hsueh and Lewis 2013; Clark 2015). At the same time, it is clear that fossil fuel producers—and the political and economic interests tied to them—can pose formidable obstacles to climate action (Erickson et al. 2015; Erickson and Lazarus 2015; Seto et al. 2016).

With these considerations in mind, several economists have proposed and analyzed supply-side approaches to climate policy (Collier and Venables 2014; Harstad 2012; Sinn 2008). Climate activists are increasingly focusing on the supply side of the fossil fuel economy as well, rallying opposition to new fossil fuel supply infrastructure—from coal terminals and oil pipelines—and the development of new resources, from exploratory oil drilling in the Arctic to new coal mines in Australia (Piggot 2018). They have also spurred a movement that has spurred individuals and institutions to commit over US$5 trillion in assets to funds that a divested from fossil fuel companies (Ansar et al. 2013; Arabella Advisors 2016).

Yet, despite recent attention, supply-side climate strategies have yet to gain a strong foothold in mainstream climate policy discourse. For example, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports as well as the multitude of nationally determined contributions to date have focused almost exclusively on demand-side approaches and have featured few if any supply-side measures (Piggot et al. 2018). This Special Issue thus aims to heighten awareness of supply-side policies and deepen understanding of their feasibility and effectiveness through a set of contributions that explore various supply-side policies and measures using a variety of lenses, including energy-economic modeling, political economy analysis, international relations theory, and ethics.

Drawing on these contributions as well as other literature, much of which is relatively recent, this introductory article first discusses the challenge of addressing fossil fuel supply in the context of global climate goals, before elaborating rationales that underpin supply-side climate policy. Next, the article classifies a range of potential supply-side policies and measures and then explores the political and ethical dimensions of a transition away from fossil fuel supply. In our conclusions, we identify promising areas for further research.

The supply-side challenge
Investments in oil, coal, and gas exploration, extraction, and transport have averaged approximately US$1 trillion annually in recent years and are poised to exceed US$20 trillion cumulatively from 2017 to 2040 under the IEA’s New Policies Scenario (IEA 2016, 2017). As with other capital-intensive fossil fuel infrastructure, these investments can deepen carbon lock-in, perpetuating dependence on coal, oil, and gas for decades to come and putting climate protection goals further at risk.

At the same time, these investments are increasingly exposed to risks of asset stranding, as nations contemplate more determined efforts to decarbonize through gradually more ambitious pledges under the Paris Agreement. Persistent low fossil fuel prices in recent years have slowed the pace of investment, driving oil and gas producers out of high-cost resources and forcing coal producers into bankruptcy. In recent years, researchers and investment advisors and regulators have sounded warnings to the investment community that fossil fuel supply investments may become “stranded” if they misread the extent and timing of climate policy and advances in low-carbon alternatives (Leaton et al. 2013; HSBC Global Research 2013; Fulton and Weber 2015; Clark 2015; Johnson et al. 2015). Their message has been amplified by the divestment movement (Ayling and Gunningham 2017; Gunningham 2017), which has urged investors—including churches, universities, and sovereign wealth funds—to stop investing in fossil fuel stocks.

The flipside of stranded assets is the notion that carbon-intensive investments create dependencies, political and institutional interests, and economic advantages that make it more difficult to move to lower-carbon pathways and thus reduce climate risks (Erickson et al. 2015; Seto et al. 2016). Overcoming this lock-in requires more than switching to low-carbon technologies or building the necessary infrastructure (e.g., an electricity grid that can power a large number of electric vehicles). It will require overcoming fossil fuel incumbency and carbon entanglement in the broadest sense, including existing power relations between governments and fossil fuel industries, as well as changes in individual as well as social-structural behavior (Geels 2014; Seto et al. 2016).

Governments in major fossil fuel-producing regions have yet to reckon fully with this challenge. As Mark Jaccard, James Hoffele, and Torsten Jaccard note in their analysis of Canadian oil sands in this issue, the disconnect between the 2 °C goal, existing commitments, and current actions creates a dilemma for national governments and their explicit or implicit support for major investments that could expand fossil fuel production and transport.

Only very recently have governments taken first steps to connect climate constraints with restrictions on fossil fuel supply. In late 2015, US President Obama rejected the Keystone XL pipeline on the grounds that to address climate change, “we’re going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground rather than burn them” (The White House 2015). In late 2016, Canada joined the USA in a decision to cease new leasing of concessions for Arctic oil and gas production, citing the need for consistency with national and global climate and environmental goals (The White House 2016). And in 2017, the French government included a ban on new hydrocarbon exploration in their new climate plan (Bamat 2017). Similar moratoria on fossil fuel exploration were adopted or under consideration in Belize, Costa Rica, Ireland, and New Zealand.

There is a host of policies to constrain future fossil fuel production that governments can pursue to help achieve the shared goals of the Paris Agreement. As we describe next, while they have yet to gain widespread traction, there are many reasons to give them serious consideration.

The rationale for supply-side climate policy
If demand-side policies were ambitious enough and applied widely enough—for example, if binding, deep mitigation commitments covering the majority of global emissions were in place—they would suffice to achieve the 2 °C goal. Yet, the reality is that such policies have not yet materialized (Rogelj et al. 2016; UNEP 2017). As the urgency of the climate problem has grown, so has the need for a broader range of solutions. To that end, supply-side policies could offer several benefits as a complement to measures taken to reduce the demand for fossil fuels.

First, applying supply-side and demand-side measures together may increase the scale of emission reductions available at a given marginal cost, in effect “widening” the mitigation cost curve, by broadening the portfolio of emission reducing measures available to policy makers. For instance, Fæhn et al. (2017) find that actions to reduce investment and production in oil fields could halve the cost of achieving Norway’s contribution to global emission abatement embodied in their emission reduction target for 2020. Through market effects, such actions could reduce global oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions at a cost (of foregone profits) lower (on a per ton CO2 basis) than demand-side mitigation options that might otherwise be needed to reach the target. While mitigation costs are high in Norway due to its climate ambition and the dominance of transportation emissions, similar dynamics are likely to hold in other fossil fuel-producing regions. Indeed, as Peter Erickson and Michael Lazarus (this issue) show, the CO2 abatement costs associated with restricting coal leases could be well within the range of other options for achieving emission goals.

Second, supply-side policies and actions will tend to slow investment in fossil fuel production and trade infrastructure, limiting the extent of carbon lock-in associated with fossil fuel over-production (2015). This, in turn, can (1) lower future mitigation costs, as over-production would otherwise make fossil fuels cheaper and harder to compete with; (2) reduce stranded asset risks and the consequent market and economic inefficiencies; (3) and reduce carbon entanglement and the sociopolitical influence of fossil fuel interests.

Third, supply-side policies may increase moral pressure and public support for climate action, because action is more readily observable (e.g., closure or avoidance of coal mines or oil pipelines vs. energy efficiency actions spread across countless individual investments), actors are more readily identifiable (e.g., coal industry vs. investors in efficiency improvements), and consequences are relatively certain and exact (Collier and Venables 2014). The contribution by Fergus Green and Richard Denniss to this issue takes this argument further, positing that on three counts—perceived benefits, costs, and distributional fairness—supply-side policies have greater potential to mobilize public support than demand-side policies.

Fourth, as Green and Denniss also remind us, restrictive supply-side policies are rooted in economic theory and have been used effectively in other contexts, tobacco being a prominent example. Because fewer projects and facilities produce fossil fuels than use them, regulating on the supply-side can also reduce administrative and transaction costs.

Finally, supply-constraining policies may help to counteract the potential for resource owners—anticipating increasingly stringent future carbon policies and prices—to accelerate production in the near term, as suggested by Sinn’s “green paradox” (Sinn 2008), though some also question the overall strength of this effect (Bauer et al. 2018).

Given the many reasons to consider supply-side policies, why have they been slow to enter the climate policy discussion? As noted above, the political obstacles can be tough to surmount. Policymakers can anticipate strong political opposition from powerful coal, oil, and gas interests towards actions that directly constrain their production. Indeed, as political economists have long noted, policies benefiting concentrated interests are hard to change even if the diffuse benefits are great (Olson 1967). At the same time, as shown by Philipp Richter, Roman Mendelevitch, and Frank Jotzo in this issue, some supply-side policies, such as taxes on production or exports, could be more attractive to supplying countries than taxes on consumption or emissions regulation especially by importing countries, as such measures could improve terms of trade and government revenue. For similar reasons, Ecuador proposed that oil producers impose a carbon tax on their exports (Harrison 2015). Furthermore, Green and Denniss (this issue) suggest that supply-side policies such a moratorium on new coal mines could garner unexpected support from actors within the fossil fuel industry, for instance by pitting incumbents against new entrants.

The way that nations account for their carbon emissions—on a territorial basis—can also reduce the incentive to undertake supply-side measures as a means to meet climate targets. A nation that taxes coal exports but not domestic consumption, for example, might reduce coal consumption and emissions globally but, by indirectly encouraging domestic consumption, increase its own (Richter et al. 2015). Even though these and other supply-side policies could make important contributions to climate protection, because of how emissions are accounted, political leaders may have less incentive to implement them. One way to overcome this barrier could be to implement a parallel extraction-based accounting system (Harrison 2015; Steininger et al. 2016). Indeed, Harrison (2015) argues that shifting responsibility for carbon emissions from territorial accounting to the point of fossil fuel extraction (or final consumption) could facilitate international climate agreement.

Common perceptions about the nature of fossil fuel markets and of the climate problem can reinforce the focus on demand-side policies. Policymakers and analysts often assume that if they reduce production in one location, an equal amount will be produced in another—the assumption of “perfect substitution,” which has been evident, for example in environmental reviews of energy infrastructure projects (see Erickson and Lazarus, this issue). However, in the absence of an actor capable of controlling prices, this assumption does not hold. As in other markets, reducing oil, coal, or gas supply will tend to increase price and thus reduce demand. While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries may still seek to operate as a price-controlling actor in the global oil market, its effectiveness is increasingly questioned (Van de Graaf 2017).

Similarly, policies that reduce fossil fuel consumption can have a corresponding rebound or leakage effect, where prices decrease and stimulate added energy demand. Understanding the likely scale of rebound or leakage is important in evaluating the effectiveness of both supply- and demand-restricting policies (Greening et al. 2000; Schipper 2000; Fæhn et al. 2017). In some cases, price effects can mean that for every barrel of oil not produced, global oil consumption could decline by as much as half a barrel, suggesting that supply restrictions can be effective as climate policy (Erickson and Lazarus, this issue).

In sum, supply-side policies—from removing fossil fuel subsidies, to taxing production, to retiring assets—have the potential to offer governments valuable new tools to achieve climate goals and deserve a closer look.

Policies and measures to limit fossil fuel supply
Policies that focus on the supply-side may offer important opportunities to enhance the pace, effectiveness, and efficiency of the low-carbon energy transition. Examples of such policies include, among others, proposed moratoria on new coal mines, oil or coal export taxes, and compensation schemes for leaving fossil fuel assets in the ground.

Table 1 illustrates the range of potential supply-side climate policy instruments—economic, regulatory, government provision of goods and services, and other—borrowing the classic typology used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These policies can be implemented at the scale of individual investments (e.g., not building a coal port or oil pipeline), of (coordinated) national policies (e.g., reducing subsidies), or of collective actions or instruments by a coalition of countries (e.g., internationally harmonized fuel export limits or taxes, or international or linked cap-and-trade systems). Some could indeed become elements of national strategies and incorporated in future nationally determined contributions, though doing so would likely require new methods to estimate, if not directly account for, cross-boundary emission savings (Piggot et al. 2018).

Economic instruments
Carbon pricing and removal of fossil fuel subsidies are among the most widely discussed of climate policies and often advocated by economists as the first-best climate policy. Currently, most carbon pricing is applied at the point of fuel distribution or final use. Similarly, much of the discussion and implementation on fossil fuel subsidy reform has focused on consumer subsidies that reduce the price paid by businesses and households for fuel and electricity. However, the potential benefits of applying a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system on the supply-side and addressing subsidies to fossil fuel producers are also significant.

Indeed, economists suggest that that the most efficient point of regulation for a carbon tax (or cap-and-trade system) would be upstream at the point of fossil fuel extraction. Doing so would ensure maximum coverage and results in lower administrative costs as there are far fewer entities that produce rather than process, distribution, or consume fossil fuels (Metcalf and Weisbach 2009). If imposed globally, a carbon tax imposed at the extraction stage would distribute more tax revenue to fossil fuel producers and developing countries in general than would a tax imposed at the combustion or product consumption stage (Karstensen and Peters 2017), which might help to compensate and thus bring fossil fuel producers on board for more ambitious climate action.

Producer countries might also see advantages in taxing individual fossil fuels, notably coal. Richter, Mendelevitch, and Jotzo (this issue) compare the effects on global CO2 emissions and coal prices of a coal tax adopted, unilaterally, by a coalition of major coal exporters, by all exporters, and by all producers. They find that coal production taxes adopted by major coal producers would lead to further CO2 emission reductions and yield further revenues for these countries.

Some economists have gone one step further to suggest that trading for rights to extract fossil fuels could have advantages over the more traditional systems that trade in rights to emit greenhouse gases (Harstad 2012), especially when coupled to a process for phasing out coal production (Collier and Venables 2014). They find that if such a scheme could be implemented across major producer nations, the oil industry could part with only a fraction of its profits and still compensate the coal industry for the closure of coal mines.

Removal of subsidies for fossil fuel supply is another economic strategy that governments can pursue. Governments subsidize fossil fuel exploration and extraction to the order of 18 to 70 billion per year, depending on how subsidies are defined, an order of magnitude less than subsidies to fossil fuel consumption, but nonetheless significant (Bast et al. 2015; OECD 2017; Jewell et al. 2018). Producer subsidies can take many forms, from tax credits on exploration and production equipment, to direct payments per unit of output, to sub-market-rate leasing of nationally owned lands (Koplow et al. 2010; OECD 2013; Aldy 2013). By reducing the costs of finding and developing new oil fields and by increasing net revenues for the fuels extracted, these subsidies affect the economics of fossil fuel extraction; in the USA, for example, half of all oil production from new fields may depend on subsidies to be profitable (Erickson et al. 2017). Producer subsidies affect the quantity and pace of fuels supplied to regional or global markets. This means that their removal could ultimately reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions (Anderson and McKibbin 2000; Erickson and Lazarus 2013; Lunden and Fjaertoft 2014), though researchers may come to differing conclusions about the extent and significance of impact (Allaire and Brown 2012; Jewell et al. 2018; Metcalf 2018).

Regulatory approaches
Governments can regulate fossil fuel extraction in a number of ways. They can restrict leasing of state-owned lands and waters for coal, oil, and gas development, or elect not to develop specific resources or infrastructure (oil pipelines and terminals, coal ports, etc.) that would stimulate further extraction. Recent examples include the French ban on new oil and gas exploration, the joint Obama/Trudeau decision to place US and Canadian offshore Arctic resources off-limits for new oil and gas extraction, and Obama’s rejection of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, all undertaken to with an objective of greater consistency with global climate goals. As Erickson and Lazarus (this issue) show with a focus on the phase out of US fossil fuel leases might mean for global CO2 emissions, the climate benefits can be substantial.

The most direct form of regulation would be to set limits on fossil fuel production. As discussed by Mathieu Blondeel and Thijs Van de Graaf in this issue, both China and the USA implemented temporary moratoria on permits for new coal mines, though in China, this was not ostensibly for climate reasons. In contrast, with a clear climate intent, several Pacific island nations in 2015 proposed “a new global dialogue on the implementation of an international moratorium on the development and expansion of fossil fuel extracting industries, particularly the construction of new coal mines, as an urgent step towards decarbonising the global economy” (PIDF 2015). Employing the COALMOD-World partial equilibrium model, Roman Mendelevitch (this issue) finds that a global moratorium on new coal mines could induce a coal consumption pathway consistent with a 1.5–2 °C goal, while also compensating current owners of coal resources through increased prices and rents.

Regulatory approaches can also include explicit consideration of long-term emissions implications in the permitting and review of new production or distribution facilities. There have been increasing calls, including by key agencies in the US and Canadian governments, for more comprehensive examination of the global impacts of greenhouse gas emissions in environmental impact assessments, which some have term “climate test” for new supply infrastructure (White House CEQ 2014). For example, Jaccard, Hoffele, and Jaccard (this issue) develop a model to apply a climate test to new oil infrastructure and find that due to their cost and emissions, there is only a 5% probability that investments in expansion of oil sands capacity would be viable under a 2 °C constraint.

Government provision of goods, services, or funds, or the restriction thereof
Governments can also create instruments to acquire production rights and compensate resource owners to leave fossil fuel reserves undeveloped or otherwise restrict their production (Harstad 2012; Larrea and Murmis 2015). They can also restrict financing available to fossil fuel supply through their pension funds, investment funds, or support of multilateral finance institutions, as Ireland and Sweden have recently done, and Norway is currently considering.

One way to limit fossil fuel supply is to pay resource owners to leave fuels in the ground. The Yasuní-ITT Initiative, proposed in 2007 by the Ecuadorian government, is the most prominent example of this approach. Ecuador subsequently submitted a proposal under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that countries be granted transferrable emissions credits for ceasing fossil fuel exploration and extraction (Köhler and Michaelowa 2014). However, the Yasuní-ITT initiative ultimately failed to generate the level of funding sought from the international community, and the market mechanism proposal did not gain traction (Sovacool and Scarpaci 2016).

The politics and ethics of transitions away from fossil fuel production
Fossil fuel production is deeply embedded in many economies, often viewed as central for development, energy security, export revenue, and poverty alleviation. Many fossil fuel-producing countries are heavily dependent on the associated rents and revenues and support the industry through subsidies and direct state investment. Fossil fuel producers comprise some of the world’s largest companies and wield geopolitical influence powerful enough to stymie energy and climate policies not to their liking.

These challenges draw attention to the political dimensions of moving away from fossil fuels. Green and Denniss (this issue) explain how the power and interests of fossil fuel incumbents form a major hurdle in the shift away from fossil fuel production. However, they also show how a more nuanced understanding of the divergent interests of fossil fuel incumbents from new entrants may reveal surprising new political opportunities. In some cases, such as proposed moratoria on new coal mines, incumbents may benefit from and advocate for supply constraints.

Two articles in this issue draw attention another important factor, namely how global norms shape appropriate behavior (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998) and how changing norms can alter the politics of energy and climate policy. In his contribution, Fergus Green observes the emergence of what he calls “anti-fossil fuel norms”. He documents the origins of such norms, which stem from activities by norm entrepreneurs and norm champions, ranging from environmental activist Bill McKibben to former President Anote Tong of the small island state of Kiribati, who spearheaded a campaign against new coal mines. Green argues that anti-fossil fuel norms can spread through the political mobilization by civil society at the domestic level and through tactics (e.g., persuasion, leading-by-example) by norm-adopting states to “socialize” other states, citing the example of the Powering Past Coal Alliance launched at the UNFCCC meeting in Bonn in November 2017.

Like Green, Blondeel and Van de Graaf examine a more specific, emergent global norm—that there should be no new coal mines. While Green’s account of anti-fossil fuel norms is decidedly optimistic about their transformative power, Blondeel and Van de Graaf offer a more sobering assessment of how a new norm around limiting new coal mines has fared in five major coal-producing countries. They conclude that entrenched interests, political constellations, beliefs, and institutions have limited uptake of this norm in the countries they studied, but note that framing the norm in relation to non-climate issues (e.g., public health concerns) might further its spread.

Transitions away from fossil fuels must account for social equity, addressing the impacts specific countries and communities (Caney 2016; Kartha et al. 2016; Moss 2016; Lenferna 2018). Would it be fair to expect fossil fuel-producing developing countries to forgo their expected economic rents and development plans based upon them (Lahn and Bradley 2016; Bos and Gupta 2018)? Or, as Sivan Kartha, Simon Caney, Navroz Dubash, and Greg Muttitt (this issue) put it more provocatively, can equity frameworks and principles tell us whose carbon is burnable and whose is not? While equity frameworks and principles have had a long history in the context of the responsibility and capacity to reduce fossil fuel emissions, they are underdeveloped for the case of limiting fossil fuel supply. Kartha et al. help fill this gap by suggesting that a managed decline in fossil fuel extraction needs to ensure that key developmental priorities are met, including the provision of energy services, safeguarding livelihoods, and allowing countries to diversify their economies, thus enabling a “just transition” for affected communities (Rosemberg 2017). Moreover, they suggest that international cooperation—following the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities—will be key for supporting countries who forgo extraction.

Conclusions
Measures to influence the pace and location of fossil fuel extraction—what we refer to here as “supply-side climate policy”—remain the road less taken by those seeking to achieve global climate goals. Focusing on fossil fuel combustion is a more direct way to address CO2 emissions, and doing so has seemed more politically viable than taking on powerful interests that benefit from the extraction and distribution of fossil fuels.

Yet, it is increasingly clear that supply-side policies can bring important benefits. They can widen the mitigation cost curve, allowing greater emission reductions at the same (or lower) cost than demand-side policies alone. They can help address carbon leakage risks. They can reduce carbon lock-in effects, making it easier for lower-carbon alternatives to compete with fossil fuels, and weakening the carbon entanglement that makes it hard for many governments to adopt strong climate policies. Lastly, focusing directly on fossil fuels and the actors that supply them can bring added pressure to bear on climate change mitigation efforts and could help make the case for more ambitious global climate action. Indeed, as noted above, and in several of the contributions to this issue, some governments have begun to realize the benefits of adopting supply-side policies.

As this Special Issue suggests, the potential and limitations of supply-side climate policies deserve greater attention from climate policy researchers and practitioners. In particular, there is a need to understand how supply-side climate policies might work in specific contexts, including their economic and environmental impacts. Examples cited here, such as the French moratorium on oil and gas exploration, are a good starting point for such studies. In some cases, such as the reform of fossil fuel producer subsidies, oil export restrictions, or the shuttering of coal mines, climate benefits cannot be the primary rationale; nonetheless, important insights can be gained related to impact on global markets or on global norms, as articles in this issue suggest. In such studies, it will be important to reflect on the interplay between supply-side and demand-side climate policies and under what conditions they are likely to complement or undermine each other.

Another key line of inquiry is how supply-side climate policy aligns with the carbon accounting and tracking systems that policymakers and observers use to judge effectiveness and take credit for action. While extraction-based accounting could provide a valuable complement to standard territorial emissions accounting, methods are still needed to better understand, track, and enable policymakers to take "
"A new study from scientists at Harvard and University College London (UCL) shows that air pollution from fossil fuels caused one in five deaths globally. The transition to clean, renewable energy presents an enormous opportunity for global public health.

 

Phasing out fossil fuels is one of the major challenges the world has to face during the 21st century, as they are the main driver of global climate change and a serious public health issue.

A study published today in Environmental Research demonstrated that more than 8 million people died prematurely in 2018 due to air pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion.

Tackling fossil fuel use is our greatest public health challenge, by Gary Cohen, president and co-founder of Health Care Without Harm, and Dr. Arvind Kumar, founder and managing trustee at Lung Care Foundation.

Small inhalable particles – PM2.5 – are the byproducts of the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and diesel. When released into the atmosphere, and given their small size, they can be inhaled and have detrimental impacts on health, including lower respiratory infections, asthma, heart disease, lung cancer, neurological damage, and birth defects.

The most affected groups are children, older adults, patients with preexisting conditions, low-income communities of color, and other marginalized communities. 



Switching to readily available sources of clean, renewable energy can save millions of lives, enhance health and well-being, and slow down the progress of climate change. For example, the state of Chhattisgarh in India promoted the solarization of rural clinics, which led to a more sustainable and reliable power supply, improved health outcomes, and reduced emissions.

Other major initiatives are underway. In 2020, England’s National Health Service (NHS) became the first health system in the world to make a commitment to achieving net-zero emissions. 



In partnership with the Skoll Foundation and film company Freethink, Health Care Without Harm released in 2020 ‘First, do no harm,’ a short film featuring physicians and health advocates working with communities around the world to address the impact of fossil fuel combustion on human health.
